abstract={Perception of pathogenic effectors in plants often relies on nucleotide-binding domain (NBS) and leucine-rich-repeat-containing (NLR) proteins. Some NLRs contain additional domains that function as integrated decoys for pathogen effector targets and activation of immune signalling. Wheat stripe rust is one of the most devastating diseases of crop plants. Here, we report the cloning of YrU1, a stripe rust resistance gene from the diploid wheat Triticum urartu, the progenitor of the A genome of hexaploid wheat. YrU1 encodes a coiled-coil-NBS-leucine-rich repeat protein with N-terminal ankyrin-repeat and C-terminal WRKY domains, representing a unique NLR structure in plants. Database searches identify similar architecture only in wheat relatives. Transient expression of YrU1 in Nicotiana benthamiana does not induce cell death in the absence of pathogens. The ankyrin-repeat and coiled-coil domains of YrU1 self-associate, suggesting that homodimerisation is critical for YrU1 function. The identification and cloning of this disease resistance gene sheds light on NLR protein function and may facilitate breeding to control the devastating wheat stripe rust disease. © 2020, The Author(s).},

abstract={Background: Flavonoids are produced in all flowering plants in a wide range of tissues including in berry fruits. These compounds are of considerable interest for their biological activities, health benefits and potential pharmacological applications. However, transcriptomic and genomic resources for wild and cultivated berry fruit species are often limited, despite their value in underpinning the in-depth study of metabolic pathways, fruit ripening as well as in the identification of genotypes rich in bioactive compounds. Results: To access the genetic diversity of wild and cultivated berry fruit species that accumulate high levels of phenolic compounds in their fleshy berry(-like) fruits, we selected 13 species from Europe, South America and Asia representing eight genera, seven families and seven orders within three clades of the kingdom Plantae. RNA from either ripe fruits (ten species) or three ripening stages (two species) as well as leaf RNA (one species) were used to construct, assemble and analyse de novo transcriptomes. The transcriptome sequences are deposited in the BacHBerryGEN database (http://jicbio.nbi.ac.uk/berries) and were used, as a proof of concept, via its BLAST portal (http://jicbio.nbi.ac.uk/berries/blast.html) to identify candidate genes involved in the biosynthesis of phenylpropanoid compounds. Genes encoding regulatory proteins of the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway (MYB and basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors and WD40 repeat proteins) were isolated using the transcriptomic resources of wild blackberry (Rubus genevieri) and cultivated red raspberry (Rubus idaeus cv. Prestige) and were shown to activate anthocyanin synthesis in Nicotiana benthamiana. Expression patterns of candidate flavonoid gene transcripts were also studied across three fruit developmental stages via the BacHBerryEXP gene expression browser (http://www.bachberryexp.com) in R. genevieri and R. idaeus cv. Prestige. Conclusions: We report a transcriptome resource that includes data for a wide range of berry(-like) fruit species that has been developed for gene identification and functional analysis to assist in berry fruit improvement. These resources will enable investigations of metabolic processes in berries beyond the phenylpropanoid biosynthetic pathway analysed in this study. The RNA-seq data will be useful for studies of berry fruit development and to select wild plant species useful for plant breeding purposes. © 2019 The Author(s).},

abstract={MOTIVATION: Thanks to the recent advances in structural biology, nowadays 3D structures of various proteins are solved on a routine basis. A large portion of these structures contain structural repetitions or internal symmetries. To understand the evolution mechanisms of these proteins and how structural repetitions affect the protein function, we need to be able to detect such proteins very robustly. As deep learning is particularly suited to deal with spatially organized data, we applied it to the detection of proteins with structural repetitions. RESULTS: We present DeepSymmetry, a versatile method based on 3D convolutional networks that detects structural repetitions in proteins and their density maps. Our method is designed to identify tandem repeat proteins, proteins with internal symmetries, symmetries in the raw density maps, their symmetry order and also the corresponding symmetry axes. Detection of symmetry axes is based on learning 6D Veronese mappings of 3D vectors, and the median angular error of axis determination is less than one degree. We demonstrate the capabilities of our method on benchmarks with tandem-repeated proteins and also with symmetrical assemblies. For example, we have discovered about 7800 putative tandem repeat proteins in the PDB. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The method is available at https://team.inria.fr/nano-d/software/deepsymmetry. It consists of a C++ executable that transforms molecular structures into volumetric density maps, and a Python code based on the TensorFlow framework for applying the DeepSymmetry model to these maps.

abstract={Soil salinity globally affects the productivity of staple food crops. Therefore, an understanding of the molecular mechanisms that lead to salt tolerance induced by antioxidant mechanisms can assist in the development of salt-tolerant crops. To decipher the molecular fingerprint of salt resistance, in this study, six salt-tolerant cowpea genotypes at the seedling stage were assessed for their antioxidant responses, yield, genetic polymorphism and proteomics under salt stress. Leaves and roots showed distinct tissue-specific responses to salinity, and leaves showed a better protection against salt stress-induced oxidative stress than roots. Inter simple sequence repeat (ISSR) fingerprinting allowed molecular discrimination between salt-tolerant cowpea genotypes. Proteome analysis of cowpea leaves under salt stress revealed up-regulation of ATP synthase, vacuolar ATPase, pentatricopeptide repeat protein, flavanone 3-hydroxylase and outer envelope pore protein. Thus, ISSR and proteome analysis allow the identification of salt-tolerant cowpea cultivars. © 1996-2019.},

abstract={Type III polyketide synthases (PKSs) are comparatively small homodimeric enzymes affording natural products with diverse structures and functions. While type III PKS biosynthetic pathways have been studied thoroughly in plants, their counterparts from bacteria and fungi are to date scarcely characterized. This gap is exemplified by myxobacteria from which no type III PKS-derived small molecule has previously been isolated. In this study, we conducted a genomic survey of myxobacterial type III PKSs and report the identification of uncommon alkylpyrones as the products of type III PKS biosynthesis from the myxobacterial model strain Myxococcus xanthus DK1622 through a self-resistance-guided screening approach focusing on genes encoding pentapetide repeat proteins, proficient to confer resistance to topoisomerase inhibitors. Using promoter-induced gene expression in the native host as well as heterologous expression of biosynthetic type III PKS genes, sufficient amounts of material could be obtained for structural elucidation and bioactivity testing, revealing potent topoisomerase activity in vitro. © 2018, Society for Industrial Microbiology and Biotechnology.},

abstract={Hybrid breeding in sunflowers based on CMS PET1 requires development of restorer lines carrying, in most cases, the restorer gene Rf1. Markers for marker-assisted selection have been developed, but there is still need for closer, more versatile, and co-dominant markers linked to Rf1. Homology searches against the reference sunflower genome using sequences of cloned markers, as well as Bacterial Artificial Chromosome (BAC)-end sequences of clones hybridizing to them, allowed the identification of two genomic regions of 30 and 3.9 Mb, respectively, as possible physical locations of the restorer gene Rf1 on linkage group 13. Nine potential candidate genes, encoding six pentatricopeptide repeat proteins, one tetratricopeptide-like helical domain, a probable aldehyde dehydrogenase 22A1, and a probable poly(A) polymerase 3 (PAPS3), were identified in these two genomic regions. Amplicon targeted next generation sequencing of these nine candidate genes for Rf1 was performed in an association panel consisting of 27 maintainer and 32 restorer lines and revealed the presence of 210 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) and 67 Insertions/Deletions (INDELs). Association studies showed significant associations of 10 SNPs with fertility restoration (p-value &lt; 10−4 ), narrowing Rf1 down to three candidate genes. Three new markers, one co-dominant marker 67N04_P and two dominant markers, PPR621.5R for restorer, and PPR621.5M for maintainer lines were developed and verified in the association panel of 59 sunflower lines. The versatility of the three newly developed markers, as well as of three existing markers for the restorer gene Rf1 (HRG01 and HRG02, Cleaved Amplified Polymorphic Sequence (CAPS)-marker H13), was analyzed in a large association panel consisting of 557 accessions. © 2019 by the authors.

abstract={Legionella pneumophila is a freshwater bacterium that replicates in predatory amoeba and alveolar macrophage. The ability of L. pneumophila to thrive in eukaryotic host cells is conferred by the Legionella containing vacuole (LCV). Formation and intracellular trafficking of the LCV are governed by an arsenal of effector proteins, many of which are secreted by the Icm/Dot Type 4 Secretion System. One such effector, known as LpnE (L. pneumophila Entry), has been implicated in facilitating bacterial entry into host cells, LCV trafficking, and substrate translocation. LpnE belongs to a subfamily of tetratricopeptide repeat proteins known as Sel1-like repeats (SLRs). All eight of the predicted SLRs in LpnE are required to promote host cell invasion. Herein, we report that LpnE(1-375) localizes to cis-Golgi in HEK293 cells via its signal peptide (aa 1–22). We further verify the interaction of LpnE(73-375) and LpnE(22-375) with Oculocerebrorenal syndrome of Lowe protein (OCRL) residues 10–208, restricting the known interacting residues for both proteins. To further characterize the SLR region of LpnE, we solved the crystal structure of LpnE(73-375) to 1.75Å resolution. This construct comprises all SLRs, which are arranged in a superhelical fold. The α-helices forming the inner concave surface of the LpnE superhelix suggest a potential protein–protein interaction interface.

abstract={Background: Many small peptides regulate eukaryotic cell biology. In fungi, some of these peptides are produced after KEX2 protease activity on proteins displaying repetitions of identical or nearly identical motifs. Following this endoprotease activity, peptides are released in the extracellular space. This type of protein maturation is involved in the production of the α-type sexual pheromone in Ascomycota. In other cases, this processing allows the production of secreted peptides regulating fungal cell wall structure or acting as mycotoxins. In this work, we report for the first time a genome-wide search of KEX2-processed repeat proteins that we call KEPs. We screened the secreted proteins of 250 fungal species to compare their KEP repertoires with regard to their lifestyle, morphology or lineage. Results: Our analysis points out that nearly all fungi display putative KEPs, suggesting an ancestral origin common to all opisthokonts. As expected, our pipeline identifies mycotoxins but also α-type sexual pheromones in Ascomycota that have not been explored so far, and unravels KEP-derived secreted peptides of unknown functions. Some species display an expansion of this class of proteins. Interestingly, we identified conserved KEPs in pathogenic fungi, suggesting a role in virulence. We also identified KEPs in Basidiomycota with striking similarities to Ascomycota α-type sexual pheromones, suggesting they may also play alternative roles in unknown signalling processes. Conclusions: We identified putative, new, unexpected secreted peptides that fall into different functional categories: mycotoxins, hormones, sexual pheromones, or effectors that promote colonization during host-microbe interactions. This wide survey will open new avenues in the field of small-secreted peptides in fungi that are critical regulators of their intimate biology and modulators of their interaction with the environment. © 2019 The Author(s).},

abstract={RNA-RNA interactions are key mechanisms through which noncoding RNA (ncRNA) regions exert biological functions. Computational prediction of RNA-RNA interactions is an essential method for detecting novel RNA-RNA interactions because their comprehensive detection by biological experimentation is still quite difficult. Many RNA-RNA interaction prediction tools have been developed, but they tend to produce many false positives. Accordingly, assessment of the statistical significance of computationally predicted interactions is an important task. However, there is no method to evaluate the statistical significance of RNA-RNA interactions that is applicable to interactions between two long RNA sequences. We developed a method to calculate the p-value for the minimal interaction energy between two long RNA sequences. The developed method depends on the fact that minimum interaction energies of RNA-RNA interactions between long RNAs follow a Gumbel distribution when repeat sequences in RNAs are masked. To show the usefulness of the developed method, we applied it to whole human 5′-untranslated region (UTR) and 3′-UTR sequences to detect novel 5′-UTR-3′-UTR interactions. We thus identified two significant 5′-UTR-3′-UTR interactions. Specifically, the human small proline-rich repeat protein 3 shows conserved 5′-UTR-3′-UTR interactions with some nucleotide variations preserving base pairings among primates. Our developed method enables us to detect statistically significant RNA-RNA interactions between long RNAs such as long ncRNAs. Statistical significance estimates help in identification of interactions for experimental validation and provide novel insights into the function of ncRNA regions. © Copyright 2018, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2018.},

abstract={RepeatsDB-lite (http://protein.bio.unipd.it/repeatsdb-lite) is a web server for the prediction of repetitive structural elements and units in tandem repeat (TR) proteins. TRs are a widespread but poorly annotated class of non-globular proteins carrying heterogeneous functions. RepeatsDB-lite extends the prediction to all TR types and strongly improves the performance both in terms of computational time and accuracy over previous methods, with precision above 95% for solenoid structures. The algorithm exploits an improved TR unit library derived from the RepeatsDB database to perform an iterative structural search and assignment. The web interface provides tools for analyzing the evolutionary relationships between units and manually refine the prediction by changing unit positions and protein classification. An all-against-all structure-based sequence similarity matrix is calculated and visualized in real-time for every user edit.

abstract={Hemerythrin-like proteins have generally been studied for their ability to reversibly bind oxygen through their binuclear nonheme iron centers. However, in recent years, it has become increasingly evident that some members of the hemerythrin-like superfamily also participate in many other biological processes. For instance, the binuclear nonheme iron site of YtfE, a hemerythrin-like protein involved in the repair of iron centers in Escherichia coli, catalyzes the reduction of nitric oxide to nitrous oxide, and the human F-box/LRR-repeat protein 5, which contains a hemerythrin-like domain, is involved in intracellular iron homeostasis. Furthermore, structural data on hemerythrin-like domains from two proteins of unknown function, PF0695 from Pyrococcus furiosus and NMB1532 from Neisseria meningitidis, show that the cation-binding sites, typical of hemerythrin, can be absent or be occupied by metal ions other than iron. To systematically investigate this functional and structural diversity of the hemerythrin-like superfamily, we have collected hemerythrin-like sequences from a database comprising fully sequenced proteomes and generated a cluster map based on their all-against-all pairwise sequence similarity. Our results show that the hemerythrin-like superfamily comprises a large number of protein families which can be classified into three broad groups on the basis of their cation-coordinating residues: (a) signal-transduction and oxygen-carrier hemerythrins (H-HxxxE-HxxxH-HxxxxD); (b) hemerythrin-like (H-HxxxE-H-HxxxE); and, (c) metazoan F-box proteins (H-HExxE-H-HxxxE). Interestingly, all but two hemerythrin-like families exhibit internal sequence and structural symmetry, suggesting that a duplication event may have led to the origin of the hemerythrin domain. © 2018 The Protein Society},

abstract={Armadillo repeat family is well-characterized in several plant species for their involvement in multiple regulatory processes including growth, development, and stress response. We have previously shown a three-fold higher expression of ARM protein-encoding in tomato cultivar tolerant to tomato leaf curl New Delhi virus (ToLCNDV) compared to susceptible cultivar upon virus infection. This suggests the putative involvement of ARM proteins in defense response against virus infection; however, no comprehensive investigation has been performed to address this inference. In the present study, we have identified a total of 46 ARM-repeat proteins (SlARMs), and 41 U-box-containing proteins (SlPUBs) in tomato. These proteins and their corresponding genes were studied for their physicochemical properties, gene structure, domain architecture, chromosomal localization, phylogeny, and cis-regulatory elements in the upstream promoter region. Expression profiling of candidate genes in response to ToLCNDV infection in contrasting tomato cultivars showed significant upregulation of SlARM18 in the tolerant cultivar. Virus-induced gene silencing of SlARM18 in the tolerant tomato cultivar conferred susceptibility, which suggests the involvement of this gene in resistance mechanism. Further studies are underway to functionally characterize SlARM18 to delineate its precise role in defense mechanism. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Background: The plant immune system is innate and encoded in the germline. Using it efficiently, plants are capable of recognizing a diverse range of rapidly evolving pathogens. A recently described phenomenon shows that plant immune receptors are able to recognize pathogen effectors through the acquisition of exogenous protein domains from other plant genes. Results: We show that plant immune receptors with integrated domains are distributed unevenly across their phylogeny in grasses. Using phylogenetic analysis, we uncover a major integration clade, whose members underwent repeated independent integration events producing diverse fusions. This clade is ancestral in grasses with members often found on syntenic chromosomes. Analyses of these fusion events reveals that homologous receptors can be fused to diverse domains. Furthermore, we discover a 43 amino acid long motif associated with this dominant integration clade which is located immediately upstream of the fusion site. Sequence analysis reveals that DNA transposition and/or ectopic recombination are the most likely mechanisms of formation for nucleotide binding leucine rich repeat proteins with integrated domains. Conclusions: The identification of this subclass of plant immune receptors that is naturally adapted to new domain integration will inform biotechnological approaches for generating synthetic receptors with novel pathogen "baits." © 2018 The Author(s).},

abstract={In recent years, a number of new protein structures that possess tandem repeats have emerged. Many of these proteins are comprised of tandem arrays of β-hairpins. Today, the amount and variety of the data on these β-hairpin repeat (BHR) structures have reached a level that requires detailed analysis and further classification. In this paper, we classified the BHR proteins, compared structures, sequences of repeat motifs, functions and distribution across the major taxonomic kingdoms of life and within organisms. As a result, we identified six different BHR folds in tandem repeat proteins of Class III (elongated structures) and one BHR fold (up-and-down β-barrel) in Class IV (“closed” structures). Our survey reveals the high incidence of the BHR proteins among bacteria and viruses and their possible relationship to the structures of amyloid fibrils. It indicates that BHR folds will be an attractive target for future structural studies, especially in the context of age-related amyloidosis and emerging infectious diseases. This work allowed us to update the RepeatsDB database, which contains annotated tandem repeat protein structures and to construct sequence profiles based on BHR structural alignments. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Leptospirosis is an important zoonotic disease, and the major outbreak of this disease in Thailand in 1999 was due largely to the Leptospira borgpetersenii serovar Sejroe. Identification of the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) LBJ_2271 protein containing immunogenic epitopes and the discovery of the LBJ_2271 ortholog in Leptospira serovar Sejroe, KU_Sej_R21_2271, led to further studies of the antigenic immune properties of KU_Sej_LRR_2271. The recombinant hybrid (rh) protein was created and expressed from a hybrid PCR fragment of KU_Sej_R21_2271 fused with DNA encoding the LBJ_2271 signal sequence for targeting protein as a membrane-anchoring protein. The fusion DNA was cloned into pET160/GW/D-TOPO® to form the pET160_hKU_R21_2271 plasmid. The plasmid was used to express the rhKU_Sej_LRR_2271 protein in Escherichia coli BL21 Star™ (DE3). The expressed protein was immunologically detected by Western blotting and immunoreactivity detection with hyperimmune sera, T cell epitope prediction by HLA allele and epitope peptide binding affinity, and potential T cell reactivity analysis. The immunogenic epitopes of the protein were evaluated and verified by HLA allele and epitope peptide complex structure molecular docking. Among fourteen best allele epitopes of this protein, binding affinity values of 12 allele epitopes remained unchanged compared to LBJ_2271. Two epitopes for alleles HLA-A0202 and -A0301 had higher IC50 values, while T cell reactivity values of these peptides were better than values from LBJ_2271 epitopes. Eight of twelve epitope peptides had positive T-cell reactivity scores. Although the molecular docking of two epitopes, 3FPLLKEFLV11/47FPLLKEFLV55 and 50KLSTVPEGV58, into an HLA-A0202 model revealed a good fit in the docked structures, 50KLSTVPEGV58 and 94KLSTVPEEV102 are still considered as the proteins' best epitopes for allele HLA-A0202. The results of this study showed that rhKU_Sej_LRR_2271 protein contained natural immunological properties that should be further examined with respect to antigenic immune stimulation for vaccine development to prevent prevalent leptospiral serovar infection in Thailand. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Epigenetic memory in Norway spruce affects the timing of bud burst and bud set, vitally important adaptive traits for this long-lived forest species. Epigenetic memory is established in response to the temperature conditions during embryogenesis. Somatic embryogenesis at different epitype inducing (EpI) temperatures closely mimics the natural processes of epigenetic memory formation in seeds, giving rise to epigenetically different clonal plants in a reproducible and predictable manner, with respect to altered bud phenology. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) and other small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs) play an essential role in the regulation of plant gene expression and may affect this epigenetic mechanism. We used NGS sequencing and computational in silico methods to identify and profile conserved and novel miRNAs among small RNAs in embryogenic tissues of Norway spruce at three EpI temperatures (18, 23 and 28°C). We detected three predominant classes of sRNAs related to a length of 24 nt, followed by a 21-22 nt class and a third 31 nt class of sRNAs. More than 2100 different miRNAs within the prevailing length 21-22 nt were identified. Profiling these putative miRNAs allowed identification of 1053 highly expressed miRNAs, including 523 conserved and 530 novels. 654 of these miRNAs were found to be differentially expressed (DEM) depending on EpI temperature. For most DEMs, we defined their putative mRNA targets. The targets represented mostly by transcripts of multiple-repeats proteins, like TIR, NBS-LRR, PPR and TPR repeat, Clathrin/VPS proteins, Myb-like, AP2, etc. Notably, 124 DE miRNAs targeted 203 differentially expressed epigenetic regulators. Developing Norway spruce embryos possess a more complex sRNA structure than that reported for somatic tissues. A variety of the predicted miRNAs showed distinct EpI temperature dependent expression patterns. These putative EpI miRNAs target spruce genes with a wide range of functions, including genes known to be involved in epigenetic regulation, which in turn could provide a feedback process leading to the formation of epigenetic marks. We suggest that TIR, NBS and LRR domain containing proteins could fulfill more general functions for signal transduction from external environmental stimuli and conversion them into molecular response. Fine-tuning of the miRNA production likely participates in both developmental regulation and epigenetic memory formation in Norway spruce. © 2017 Yakovlev and Fossdal.},

abstract={Key message: qFS07.1 controlling fiber strength was fine-mapped to a 62.6-kb region containing four annotated genes. RT-qPCR and sequence of candidate genes identified an LRR RLK gene as the most likely candidate. Abstract: Fiber strength is an important component of cotton fiber quality and is associated with other properties, such as fiber maturity, fineness, and length. Stable QTL qFS07.1, controlling fiber strength, had been identified on chromosome 7 in an upland cotton recombinant inbred line (RIL) population from a cross (CCRI35 × Yumian1) described in our previous studies. To fine-map qFS07.1, an F2 population with 2484 individual plants from a cross between recombinant line RIL014 and CCRI35 was established. A total of 1518 SSR primer pairs, including 1062, designed from chromosome 1 of the Gossypium raimondii genome and 456 from chromosome 1 of the G. arboreum genome (corresponding to the QTL region) were used to fine-map qFS07.1, and qFS07.1 was mapped into a 62.6-kb genome region which contained four annotated genes on chromosome A07 of G. hirsutum. RT-qPCR and comparative analysis of candidate genes revealed a leucine-rich repeat protein kinase (LRR RLK) family protein to be a promising candidate gene for qFS07.1. Fine mapping and identification of the candidate gene for qFS07.1 will play a vital role in marker-assisted selection (MAS) and the study of mechanism of cotton fiber development. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={The superfamily of armadillo repeat proteins is a fascinating archetype of modular-binding proteins involved in various fundamental cellular processes, including cell–cell adhesion, cytoskeletal organization, nuclear import, and molecular signaling. Despite their diverse functions, they all share tandem armadillo (ARM) repeats, which stack together to form a conserved three-dimensional structure. This superhelical armadillo structure enables them to interact with distinct partners by wrapping around them. Despite the important functional roles of this superfamily, a comprehensive analysis of the composition, classification, and phylogeny of this protein superfamily has not been reported. Furthermore, relatively little is known about a subset of ARM proteins, and some of the current annotations of armadillo repeats are incomplete or incorrect, often due to high similarity with HEAT repeats. We identified the entire armadillo repeat superfamily repertoire in the human genome, annotated each armadillo repeat, and performed an extensive evolutionary analysis of the armadillo repeat proteins in both metazoan and premetazoan species. Phylogenetic analyses of the superfamily classified them into several discrete branches with members showing significant sequence homology, and often also related functions. Interestingly, the phylogenetic structure of the superfamily revealed that about 30 % of the members predate metazoans and represent an ancient subset, which is gradually evolving to acquire complex and highly diverse functions. © 2016, Springer International Publishing.},

abstract={RepeatsDB 2.0 (URL: http://repeatsdb.bio.unipd.it/) is an update of the database of annotated tandem repeat protein structures. Repeat proteins are a widespread class of non-globular proteins carrying heterogeneous functions involved in several diseases. Here we provide a new version of RepeatsDB with an improved classification schema including high quality annotations for ∼5400 protein structures. RepeatsDB 2.0 features information on start and end positions for the repeat regions and units for all entries. The extensive growth of repeat unit characterization was possible by applying the novel ReUPred annotation method over the entire Protein Data Bank, with data quality is guaranteed by an extensive manual validation for >60% of the entries. The updated web interface includes a new search engine for complex queries and a fully re-designed entry page for a better overview of structural data. It is now possible to compare unit positions, together with secondary structure, fold information and Pfam domains. Moreover, a new classification level has been introduced on top of the existing scheme as an independent layer for sequence similarity relationships at 40%, 60% and 90% identity. © 2016 The Author(s).},

abstract={Background: Pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins are encoded by a large gene family of approximately 450 members in Arabidopsis and 477 in rice, which characterized by tandem repetitions of a degenerate 35 amino acid characteristic sequence motifs. A large majority of the PPR genes in the higher plants are localized in organelles. Their functions remain as yet largely unknown. The majority of characterized PPR proteins have been found to function in modulating the expression plastid and mitochondrial genes in plants. Results: Here, a genome-wide identification and comparison of the PPR genes from 5 organisms was performed, including the moss Physcomitrella patens, the lycophyte Selaginella moellendorffii, the eudicot Arabidopsis, and the monocots rice and foxtail millet. It appears that the expansion of this gene family prior to the divergence of the euphyllophytes and the lycophytes in land plants. The duplication and divergence rates of the foxtail millet PPR genes (SiPPRs) showed that the expansion period of this gene family around 400 Mya, and indicated that genome segmental duplication was very likely the primary mechanism underlying the expansion of the PPR gene family in vascular plants. An analysis of a complete set of SiPPR genes/proteins that included classification, chromosomal location, orthologous relationships, duplication analysis, and auxiliary motifs is presented. Expression analysis of the SiPPR genes under stress conditions revealed that the expression of 24 SiPPR genes was responsive to abiotic stress. Subcellular localization analysis of 11 PPR proteins indicated that 5 proteins were localized to chloroplasts, that 4 were localized to mitochondria, and that 2 were localized to the cytoplasm. Conclusions: Our results contribute to a more comprehensive understanding the roles of PPR proteins and will be useful in the prioritization of particular PPR proteins for subsequent functional validation studies in foxtail millet. © 2016 The Author(s).},

abstract={A WD40 protein typically contains four or more repeats of ~40 residues ended with the Trp-Asp dipeptide, which folds into β-propellers with four β strands in each repeat. They often function as scaffolds for protein-protein interactions and are involved in numerous fundamental biological processes. Despite their important functional role, the "velcro" closure of WD40 propellers and the diversity of WD40 repeats make their identification a difficult task. Here we develop a new WD40 Repeat Recognition method (WDRR), which uses predicted secondary structure information to generate candidate repeat segments, and further employs a profile-profile alignment to identify the correct WD40 repeats from candidate segments. In particular, we design a novel alignment scoring function that combines dot product and BLOSUM62, thereby achieving a great balance of sensitivity and accuracy. Taking advantage of these strategies, WDRR could effectively reduce the false positive rate and accurately identify more remote homologous WD40 repeats with precise repeat boundaries. We further use WDRR to re-annotate the Pfam families in the β-propeller clan (CL0186) and identify a number of WD40 repeat proteins with high confidence across nine model organisms.

abstract={Over the last decade, numerous studies have demonstrated the fundamental importance of tandem repeat (TR) proteins in many biological processes. A plethora of new repeat structures have also been solved. The recently published RepeatsDB provides information on TR proteins. However, a detailed structural characterization of repetitive elements is largely missing, as repeat unit annotation is manually curated and currently covers only 3 % of the bona fide TR proteins. Repeat Protein Unit Predictor (ReUPred) is a novel method for the fast automatic prediction of repeat units and repeat classification using an extensive Structure Repeat Unit Library (SRUL) derived from RepeatsDB. ReUPred uses an iterative structural search against the SRUL to find repetitive units. On a test set of solenoid proteins, ReUPred is able to correctly detect 92 % of the proteins. Unlike previous methods, it is also able to correctly classify solenoid repeats in 89 % of cases. It also outperforms two recent state-of-the-art methods for the repeat unit identification problem. The accurate prediction of repeat units increases the number of annotated repeat units by an order of magnitude compared to the sequence-based Pfam classification. ReUPred is implemented in Python for Linux and freely available from the URL: http://protein.bio.unipd.it/reupred/. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Wien.},

abstract={Motivation: Developments in biotechnology have enabled the in vitro evolution of binding proteins. The emerging limitations of antibodies in binding protein engineering have led to suggestions for other proteins as alternative binding protein scaffolds. Most of these proteins were selected based on human intuition rather than systematic analysis of the available data. To improve this strategy, we developed a computational framework for finding desirable binding protein scaffolds by utilizing protein structure and sequence information. Results: For each protein, its structure and the sequences of evolutionarily-related proteins were analyzed, and spatially contiguous regions composed of highly variable residues were identified. A large number of proteins have these regions, but leucine rich repeats (LRRs), histidine kinase domains and immunoglobulin domains are predominant among them. The candidates suggested as new binding protein scaffolds include histidine kinase, LRR, titin and pentapeptide repeat protein.

abstract={Objective: To construct the expression vector for proline / arginine-rich end leucine-rich repeat protein (PRELP) shRNA and identify its silencing effect in Saos-2 cells. Methods: Two pairs of interfering sequences were designed according to the mRMA sequences of PRELP, synthesized chemically and inserted into lentivirus vector, with which Saos-2 cells were transfected at various MOIs, and the MOI at which the positive rate of GFP in cells was the highest was screened. Saos-2 cells were transfected with the constructed lentivirus vector at the screened MOI, from which the stably transfected strains were screened with puromycin. The down-regulation efficacy of PRELP in two stably transfected cell strains were verified by Western blot. Results: The lentivirus vector for PRELP shRNA was constructed successfully. When the MOI was 50, the positive rate of GFP in cells reached the maximum. Stably transfected cell strains were obtained by screening with puromycin, in which the expression of PRELP was significantly inhibited. Conclusion: The lentiviral expression vector for PRELP shRNA was constructed successfully, and the Saos-2 cell model with down-regulated expression of PRELP was established, which laid a foundation of study on role of PRELP in osteoarthritis.},

abstract={Clubroot, caused by Plasmodiophora brassicae, is an important disease on Brassica species worldwide. A clubroot resistance gene, Rcr1, with efficacy against pathotype 3 of P. brassicae, was previously mapped to chromosome A03 of B. rapa in pak choy cultivar "Flower Nabana". In the current study, resistance to pathotypes 2,5 and 6 was shown to be associated with Rcr1 region on chromosome A03. Bulked segregant RNA sequencing was performed and short read sequences were assembled into 10 chromosomes of the B. rapa reference genome v1.5. For the resistant (R) bulks, a total of 351.8 million (M) sequences, 30,836.5 million bases (Mb) in length, produced 120-fold coverage of the reference genome. For the susceptible (S) bulks, 322.9 M sequences, 28,216.6 Mb in length, produced 109-fold coverage. In total, 776.2 K single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 122.2 K insertion/deletion (InDels) in R bulks and 762.8 K SNPs and 118.7 K InDels in S bulks were identified; each chromosome had about 87% SNPs and 13% InDels, with 78% monomorphic and 22% polymorphic variants between the R and S bulks. Polymorphic variants on each chromosome were usually below 23%, but made up 34% of the variants on chromosome A03. There were 35 genes annotated in the Rcr1 target region and variants were identified in 21 genes. The numbers of poly variants differed significantly among the genes. Four out of them encode Toll-Interleukin-1 receptor/nucleotide-binding site/leucine-rich-repeat proteins; Bra019409 and Bra019410 harbored the higher numbers of polymorphic variants, which indicates that they are more likely candidates of Rcr1. Fourteen SNP markers in the target region were genotyped using the Kompetitive Allele Specific PCR method and were confirmed to associate with Rcr1. Selected SNP markers were analyzed with 26 recombinants obtained from a segregating population consisting of 1587 plants, indicating that they were completely linked to Rcr1. Nine SNP markers were used for marker-assisted introgression of Rcr1 into B. napus canola from B. rapa, with 100% accuracy in this study. © 2016 Yu et al.

abstract={Stellera chamaejasme L. is a well-recognized traditional medicine in China and can synthesizes various secondary metabolites including a group of flavonoids. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying flavonoid biosynthesis. In this study, large-scale RNA sequencing on flower of S. chamaejasme produced a de novo transcriptome consisting of 32,216 unigenes with a N50 length of 1745 bp. Among all unigenes, 21,355 unigenes were identified as putative homologs of annotated sequences in the public protein databases. Further functional classification revealed that the active genes in flower are predominately involved in metabolic process and biosynthesis of secondary metabolite pathways. A total of 19 candidate genes encoding 11 structural enzymes involved in flavonoid biosynthesis were identified in the unigene dataset by targeted searches of their annotations. In addition, a number of regulatory genes including MYB, basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH), and WD40 repeat proteins were discovered based on transcriptome dataset. Therefore, this study presents the first survey of transcriptome on the flower of S. chamaejasme to discover the major candidate genes involved in flavonoid biosynthesis pathway. These results will promote an understanding of the genetic mechanism of flavonoid biosynthesis in S. chamaejasme. At the same time, this transcriptome dataset can serve as an important public information platform for gene expression, genomic and functional genomic studies in this species. © 2015 The Authors.

abstract={BACKGROUND: RACK1 is strongly associated with the occurrence and development of oral squamous cell carcinoma. However, the occurrence and development of tumor do not depend on a gene or protein, but a long-term complex process of a network structure of multiple genes and multiple molecules, multi-step, multi-stage joint action. Synergism between tumor genes promotes the formation and development of tumor cells. Therefore, we cannot limit on a single gene or protein to discover the action mechanism of oral squamous cell carcinoma, but should pay attention on signaling network path related to differential protein or gene, investigate the alterations in related protein or gene expression in the whole signaling pathway, and analyze the action mechanism of the interaction of these molecules. OBJECTIVE: To screen differential genes related to oral squamous cell carcinoma, construct an interaction network through bioinformatics using STRING database, and provide clues for future tests. METHODS: In accordance with our previous classic proteomics results and microarray results of oral squamous cell carcinoma, genes with consistent expression and big differences were selected as differential genes. The differential genes were inputted into the database of STRING to find the possible relationship among the protein subunits and to construct network structure of their interaction. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The 19 differential proteins of oral squamous cell carcinoma construct a complicated net work, and the differential proteins interact through these networks. GNB2L1-encoded RACK1 is a node protein and interacts with other differential proteins via WD40 repeated protein (number COG2319) and β-G protein subunit (number KOG0279). WD40 repeated protein (number COG2319) interacts with 5 differential proteins directly and constructs 10 interacting pathways. β-G protein subunit (number KOG0279) interacts with 8 differential proteins directly, which has 11 interacting pathways. We make a network structure picture based on the interaction of these 19 differential genes by the analysis of the STRING database. The results show that the two subunits of RACK1 protein have direct interaction with 8 differential proteins and have 18 interaction pathways on the picture. As a result, RACK1 is the core protein of the network, suggesting RACK1 is the key node protein in oral squamous cell carcinoma. © 2015, Journal of Clinical Rehabilitative Tissue Engineering Research.

abstract={Background: Citrus represents a crop of global importance both in economic impact and significance to nutrition. Citrus production worldwide is threatened by the disease Huanglongbing (HLB), caused by the phloem-limited pathogen Candidatus Liberibacter spp.. As a source of stable HLB-resistance has yet to be identified, there is considerable interest in characterization of novel disease-associated citrus genes. Results: A gene family of Small Cyclic Amphipathic Peptides (SCAmpPs) in citrus is described. The citrus genomes contain 100-150 SCAmpPs genes, approximately 50 of which are represented in the citrus EST database. These genes encode small ~50 residue precursor proteins that are post-translationally processed, releasing 5-10 residue cyclic peptides. The structures of the SCAmpPs genes are highly conserved, with the small coding domains interrupted by a single intron and relatively extended untranslated regions. Some family members are very highly transcribed in specific citrus tissues, as determined by representation in tissue-specific cDNA libraries. Comparison of the ESTs of related SCAmpPs revealed an unexpected evolutionary profile, consistent with targeted mutagenesis of the predicted cyclic peptide domain. The SCAmpPs genes are displayed in clusters on the citrus chromosomes, with apparent association with receptor leucine-rich repeat protein arrays. This study focused on three SCAmpPs family members with high constitutive expression in citrus phloem. Unexpectedly high sequence conservation was observed in the promoter region of two phloem-expressed SCAmpPs that encode very distinct predicted cyclic products. The processed cyclic product of one of these phloem SCAmpPs was characterized by LC-MS-MS analysis of phloem tissue, revealing properties consistent with a K+ ionophore. Conclusions: The SCAmpPs amino acid composition, protein structure, expression patterns, evolutionary profile and chromosomal distribution are consistent with designation as ribosomally synthesized defense-related peptides. © Belknap et al.; licensee BioMed Central.},

abstract={WD40-repeat proteins, as one of the largest protein families, often serve as platforms to assemble functional complexes through the hotspot residues on their domain surfaces, and thus play vital roles in many biological processes.

Systematic identification of WD40-repeat proteins, including prediction of their secondary structures, tertiary structures and potential hotspot residues responsible for protein-protein interactions, may constitute a valuable resource upon this request. To achieve this goal, we developed a specialized database WDSPdb (http://wu. scbb.pkusz.edu.cn/wdsp/) to provide these details of WD40-repeat proteins based on our recently published method WDSP. The WDSPdb contains 63 211 WD40-repeat proteins identified from 3383 species, including most well-known model organisms.

abstract={The Arabidopsis thylakoid membrane bimodular oxidoreductase, AtVKOR, could catalyze disulfide bond formation, and its direct functional domain (thioredoxin-like domain) is located in the thylakoid lumen according to the topological structure. Many proteins have one or several disulfide bonds in the thylakoid lumen, including photosynthetic chain components. A yeast two-hybrid assay was used to identify potential targets for the AtVKOR, and a Trx-like domain was constructed into a BD vector as bait. Twenty-two thylakoid lumenal proteins with disulfides were selected. The cDNAs encoding these proteins were constructed into an AD vector. Eight proteins were identified from the hybrid results to interact with AtVKOR, including HCF164, cytochrome c6A, violaxanthin deepoxidase, embryo sac development arrest 3 protein (EDA3), two members pentapeptide repeat proteins (TL17 and TL20.3), and two FK-506 binding proteins (FKBP13 and FKBP20-2). The BIACORE system was used to demonstrate that the recombinant HCF164 and Trx-like domain of AtVKOR could interact directly in vitro. The KD value for binding HCF164 to AtVKOR was calculated as 2.5×10-6 M. These results suggest that AtVKOR can interact with partial thylakoid lumenal proteins and indicates AtVKOR plays an important role in regulating the thylakoid lumen redox. © 2015 Bentham Science Publishers.},

abstract={Viroids are small, covalently closed, circular non-coding RNA pathogens of flowering plants. It is proposed that the symptoms of viroid pathogenesis result from a direct interaction between the viroid genomic RNA and unknown host plant factors. Using a comparative genomic approach we took advantage of the detailed annotation of the Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) genome to identify sequence homologies between putative viroid-derived small RNAs (vd-sRNAs) and coding regions in the plant genome. A pool of sequence homologies among 29 species of the Pospiviroidae family and the Arabidopsis genome was analyzed. Using this strategy we identified putative host gene targets that may be involved in symptom expression in viroid-infected plants. In this communication, we report the in silico prediction and the experimental validation of pospiviroid-derived sRNAs conserved in the lower strand of the pathogenicity domain of seven viroid species infecting tomato; those vd-sRNAs targeted for cleavage the host mRNA encoding a conserved tomato WD40-repeat protein (SolWD40-repeat; SGN_U563134). Analysis of SolWD40-repeat expression indicated that this gene is down-regulated in tomato plants infected with tomato planta macho viroid (TPMVd). Furthermore, 5' RLM-RACE revealed that the SolWD40-repeat mRNA is cleaved at the predicted target site showing complementarity to a corresponding TPMVd-sRNA identified in silico. Our approach proved to be useful for the identification of natural host genes containing sequence homologies with segments of the Pospiviroidae genome. Using this strategy we identified a functionally conserved gene in Arabidopsis and tomato, whose expression was modified during viroid infection in the host genome; regulation of this gene expression could be guided by vd-sRNA:mRNA complementarity, suggesting that the comparison of the Arabidopsis genome to viroid sequences could lead to the identification of unexpected interactions between viroid RNAs and their host. © 2015.},

abstract={Background: Tandem repetition of structural motifs in proteins is frequently observed across all forms of life. Topology of repeating unit and its frequency of occurrence are associated to a wide range of structural and functional roles in diverse proteins, and defects in repeat proteins have been associated with a number of diseases. It is thus desirable to accurately identify specific repeat type and its copy number. Weak evolutionary constraints on repeat units and insertions/deletions between them make their identification difficult at the sequence level and structure based approaches are desired. The proposed graph spectral approach is based on protein structure represented as a graph for detecting one of the most frequently observed structural repeats, Ankyrin repeat. Results: It has been shown in a large number of studies that 3-dimensional topology of a protein structure is well captured by a graph, making it possible to analyze a complex protein structure as a mathematical entity. In this study we show that eigen spectra profile of a protein structure graph exhibits a unique repetitive profile for contiguous repeating units enabling the detection of the repeat region and the repeat type. The proposed approach uses a non-redundant set of 58 Ankyrin proteins to define rules for the detection of Ankyrin repeat motifs. It is evaluated on a set of 370 proteins comprising 125 known Ankyrin proteins and remaining non-solenoid proteins and the prediction compared with UniProt annotation, sequence-based approach, RADAR, and structure-based approach, ConSole. To show the efficacy of the approach, we analyzed the complete PDB structural database and identified 641 previously unrecognized Ankyrin repeat proteins. We observe a unique eigen spectra profile for different repeat types and show that the method can be easily extended to detect other repeat types. It is implemented as a web server, AnkPred. It is freely available at. Conclusions: AnkPred provides an elegant and computationally efficient graph-based approach for detecting Ankyrin structural repeats in proteins. By analyzing the eigen spectra of the protein structure graph and secondary structure information, characteristic features of a known repeat family are identified. This method is especially useful in correctly identifying new members of a repeat family. © 2014 Chakrabarty and Parekh; licensee BioMed Central.},

abstract={Ankrd1/CARP, Ankrd2/Arpp, and Ankrd23/DARP belong to a family of stress inducible ankyrin repeat proteins expressed in striated muscle (MARPs). The MARPs are homologous in structure and localized in the nucleus where they negatively regulate gene expression as well as in the sarcomeric I-band, where they are thought to be involved in mechanosensing. Together with their strong induction during cardiac disease and the identification of causative Ankrd1 gene mutations in cardiomyopathy patients, this suggests their important roles in cardiac development, function, and disease. To determine the functional role of MARPs in vivo, we studied knockout (KO) mice of each of the three family members. Single KO mice were viable and had no apparent cardiac phenotype. We therefore hypothesized that the three highly homologous MARP proteins may have redundant functions in the heart and studied double and triple MARP KO mice. Unexpectedly, MARP triple KO mice were viable and had normal cardiac function both at basal levels and in response to mechanical pressure overload induced by transverse aortic constriction as assessed by echocardiography and hemodynamic studies. Thus, CARP, Ankrd2, and DARP are not essential for normal cardiac development and function at basal conditions and in response to mechanical pressure overload. © 2014 Bang et al.},

abstract={RepeatsDB (http://repeatsdb.bio.unipd.it/) is a database of annotated tandem repeat protein structures. Tandem repeats pose a difficult problem for the analysis of protein structures, as the underlying sequence can be highly degenerate. Several repeat types haven been studied over the years, but their annotation was done in a case-by-case basis, thus making large-scale analysis difficult. We developed RepeatsDB to fill this gap. Using state-of-the-art repeat detection methods and manual curation, we systematically annotated the Protein Data Bank, predicting 10 745 repeat structures. In all, 2797 structures were classified according to a recently proposed classification schema, which was expanded to accommodate new findings. In addition, detailed annotations were performed in a subset of 321 proteins. These annotations feature information on start and end positions for the repeat regions and units. RepeatsDB is an ongoing effort to systematically classify and annotate structural protein repeats in a consistent way. It provides users with the possibility to access and download high-quality datasets either interactively or programmatically through web services. © 2013 The Author(s).

abstract={Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) are devastating neurodegenerative diseases that form two ends of a complex disease spectrum. Aggregation of RNA binding proteins is one of the hallmark pathologic features of ALS and FTDL and suggests perturbance of the RNA metabolism in their etiology. Recent identification of the disease-associated expansions of the intronic hexanucleotide repeat GGGGCC in the C9ORF72 gene further substantiates the case for RNA involvement. The expanded repeat, which has turned out to be the single most common genetic cause of ALS and FTLD, may enable the formation of complex DNA and RNA structures, changes in RNA transcription, and processing and formation of toxic RNA foci, which may sequester and inactivate RNA binding proteins. Additionally, the transcribed expanded repeat can undergo repeat-associated non-ATG-initiated translation resulting in accumulation of a series of dipeptide repeat proteins. Understanding the basis of the proposed mechanisms and shared pathways, as well as interactions with known key proteins such as TAR DNA-binding protein (TDP-43) are needed to clarify the pathology of ALS and/or FTLD, and make possible steps toward therapy development. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={A novel dominant resistance gene, TuRB07, was found to confer resistance to an isolate of TuMV strain C4 in B. rapa line VC1 and mapped on the top of chromosome A06. The inheritance of resistance to Turnip mosaic virus in Brassica rapa was investigated by crossing the resistant line, VC1 with the susceptible line, SR5, and genotyping and phenotyping diverse progenies derived from this cross. Both a doubled haploid population, VCS3M-DH, an F2 and two BC1 (F1 × VC1 and F1 × SR5) populations were created. Population tests revealed that the resistance to the TuMV C4 isolate in B. rapa is controlled by a single dominant gene. This resistance gene, TuRB07 was positioned on the top of linkage group A06 of the B. rapa genome through bulk segregation analysis and fine mapping recombinants in three doubled haploid- and one backcross population using microsatellite markers developed from BAC end sequences. Within the region between the two closely linked markers flanking TuRB07, H132A24-s1, and KS10960, in the Chiifu reference genome, two genes encoding nucleotide-binding site and leucine-rich repeat proteins with a coiled-coil motif (CC-NBS-LRR), Bra018862 and Bra018863 were identified as candidate resistance genes. The gene Bra018862 is truncated, but the gene Bra018863 has all the domains to function. Furthermore, the analysis of structural variation using resequencing data of VC1 and SR5 revealed that Bra018863 might be a functional gene because the gene has no structural variation in the resistant line VC1 when compared with Chiifu, whereas at the other NBS-LRR genes large deletions were identified in the resistant line. Allelic differences of Bra018863 were found between VC1 and SR5, supporting the notion that this gene is a putative candidate gene for the virus resistance.},

abstract={Summary RNA editing modifies cytidines (C) to uridines (U) at specific sites in the transcripts of mitochondria and plastids, altering the amino acid specified by the DNA sequence. Here we report the identification of a critical editing factor of mitochondrial nad7 transcript via molecular characterization of a small kernel 1 (smk1) mutant in Zea mays (maize). Mutations in Smk1 arrest both the embryo and endosperm development. Cloning of Smk1 indicates that it encodes an E-subclass pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) protein that is targeted to mitochondria. Loss of SMK1 function abolishes the C → U editing at the nad7-836 site, leading to the retention of a proline codon that is edited to encode leucine in the wild type. The smk1 mutant showed dramatically reduced complex-I assembly and NADH dehydrogenase activity, and abnormal biogenesis of the mitochondria. Analysis of the ortholog in Oryza sativa (rice) reveals that rice SMK1 has a conserved function in C → U editing of the mitochondrial nad7-836 site. T-DNA knock-out mutants showed abnormal embryo and endosperm development, resulting in embryo or seedling lethality. The leucine at NAD7-279 is highly conserved from bacteria to flowering plants, and analysis of genome sequences from many plants revealed a molecular coevolution between the requirement for C → U editing at this site and the existence of an SMK1 homolog. These results demonstrate that Smk1 encodes a PPR-E protein that is required for nad7-836 editing, and this editing is critical to NAD7 function in complex-I assembly in mitochondria, and hence to embryo and endosperm development in maize and rice. © 2014 The Authors The Plant Journal © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract={The Xin actin-binding repeat-containing proteins Xin and XIRP2 are exclusively expressed in striated muscle cells, where they are believed to play an important role in development. In adult muscle, both proteins are concentrated at attachment sites of myofibrils to the membrane. In contrast, during development they are localized to immature myofibrils together with their binding partner, filamin C, indicating an involvement of both proteins in myofibril assembly. We identify the SH3 domains of nebulin and nebulette as novel ligands of proline-rich regions of Xin and XIRP2. Precise binding motifs are mapped and shown to bind both SH3 domains with micromolar affinity. Cocrystallization of the nebulette SH3 domain with the interacting XIRP2 peptide PPPTLPKPKLPKH reveals selective interactions that conform to class II SH3 domain-binding peptides. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation experiments in cultured muscle cells indicate a temporally restricted interaction of Xin-repeat proteins with nebulin/nebulette during early stages of myofibril development that is lost upon further maturation. In mature myofibrils, this interaction is limited to longitudinally oriented structures associated with myofibril development and remodeling. These data provide new insights into the role of Xin actin-binding repeat-containing proteins (together with their interaction partners) in myofibril assembly and after muscle damage. © 2013 Eulitz et al.},

By analyzing small RNA deep sequencing data in combination with the genome sequence, we identified 75 conserved miRNAs and 11 novel miRNAs. Their target genes were also predicted. For most conserved miRNAs, the miRNA-target pairs were conserved across plant species. In addition to these conserved miRNA-target pairs, we also identified some papaya-specific miRNA-target regulatory pathways. Both miR168 and miR530 target the Argonaute 1 gene, indicating a second autoregulatory mechanism for miRNA regulation. A non-conserved miRNA was mapped within an intron of Dicer-like 1 (DCL1), suggesting a conserved homeostatic autoregulatory mechanism for DCL1 expression. A 21-nt miRNA triggers secondary siRNA production from its target genes, nucleotide-binding site leucine-rich repeat protein genes. Certain phased-miRNAs were processed from their conserved miRNA precursors, indicating a putative miRNA evolution mechanism. In addition, we identified a Carica papaya-specific miRNA that targets an ethylene receptor gene, implying its function in the ethylene signaling pathway.

abstract={The ankyrin repeat (ANK) protein family plays a crucial role in plant growth and development and in response to biotic and abiotic stresses. However, no detailed information concerning this family is available for tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) due to the limited information on whole genome sequences.

And chromosomal localizations of SlANK genes indicated 25 SlANK genes were involved in tandem duplications. Based on their domain composition, all of the SlANK proteins were grouped into 13 subgroups. A combined phylogenetic tree was constructed with the aligned SlANK protein sequences. This tree revealed that the SlANK proteins comprise five major groups. An analysis of the expression profiles of SlANK genes in tomato in different tissues and in response to stresses showed that the SlANK proteins play roles in plant growth, development and stress responses. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a genome-wide analysis of the tomato ANK gene family.

abstract={Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) inherits the active mutation, which promotes the viral survival in human and is the main hurdle of vaccine development. The mutations on HIV surface i.e. CD4 binding site on HIV gp120, causes the escaping from the immune-surveillance but still retains the infectivity for CD4+ T cells. Formerly, Designed Ankyrin Repeat Protein (DARPin) technology has been innovated to inhibit the HIV infection. The CD4-specific DARPin specifically excludes the adhesion step of HIV to CD4 molecule and efficiently prevents HIV infection in vitro by competing with gp120, however, not in vivo. Therefore, insight into the interaction between DARPin and CD4 molecules will provide the information to improve the interaction affinity of DARPin for in vivo purpose. The binding activity can be modified by directly defining the key amino acid residues of CD4-specific DARPin and replacing them with other possible residues. To discover the remarkable CD4's residues, a molecular docking software i.e. ZDOCK was used to predict the complex structures between CD4 and DARPin. In this study, the candidate residues of CD4-specific DARPin were identified by the residues of CD4 molecule involving in gp120 interaction. The defined DARPin poses that interrelated with them were then extracted. The MATLAB software was implemented to generate the assigned screening criteria for recruiting the most relevant binding residues in eleven complex-structure-candidates derived from ZDOCK. The invented data processing methodology will assist the molecular simulation researchers to rapidly and precisely define important residues.},

abstract={Ethylene receptors play important roles not only in regulation of growth and development but also in response to environmental stimuli of plants. However, there are few reports on ethylene receptors in soybean. In this article, putative ethylene receptors of soybean were searched from soybean genomic database (http://www.phytozome.net/search.php) and analyzed. The ethylene receptor gene family in soybean comprising eight members, designated as GmERS1-1, GmERS1-2, GmETR1-1, GmETR1-2, GmETR2-1, GmETR2-2, GmEIN4-1, and GmEIN4-2 corresponding with their homologous genes in Arabidopsis, were isolated and analyzed. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the eight soybean ethylene receptors (SERs) were in two subfamilies and further divided into four groups, viz., groups I (GmERS1-1 and GmERS1-2), II (GmETR1-1 and GmETR1-2), VI (GmETR2-1 and GmETR2-2), and VII (GmEIN4-1 and GmEIN4-2). Protein structure of the members in groups I and II from subfamily I were more conserved than the members in other two groups from subfamily II. Expression patterns of the SERs were compared with the homologous genes in Arabidopsis. The results demonstrated that expression patterns of the SERs differed from Arabidopsis members in the same group, suggesting that SERs are involved in different signal pathways compared to ethylene receptors in Arabidopsis. Promoter analysis showed that the sequences of the members in each group were different from each other, and some specific binding elements of transcription factors detected in promoter sequences might explain the differences between the members in the same group. A novel soybean TPR protein (tetratricopeptide repeat protein), GmTPR, was identified to interact with GmETR1-1, apparently an important ethylene receptor in ethylene signaling pathway in soybean. This suggested that GmTPR might be a novel downstream component of the ethylene signaling pathway. © 2013 Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences.},

abstract={The WD40-repeat protein WDR5 plays a critical role in maintaining the integrity of MLL complexes and fully activating their methyltransferase function. MLL complexes, the trithorax-like family of SET1 methyltransferases, catalyze trimethylation of lysine 4 on histone 3, and they have been widely implicated in various cancers. Antagonism of WDR5 and MLL subunit interaction by small molecules has recently been presented as a practical way to inhibit activity of the MLL1 complex, and N-(2-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-5-substituted- phenyl) benzamides were reported as potent and selective antagonists of such an interaction. Here, we describe the protein crystal structure guided optimization of prototypic compound 2 (Kdis = 7 μM), leading to identification of more potent antagonist 47 (Kdis = 0.3 μM). © 2013 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Leptospirosis is considered to be a re-emerging disease that has impacts on public health both globally and in and Thailand. The leptospires outbreak in Thailand during 1999 was largely due to the etiologic agent Leptospira borgpetersenii serogroup Sejroe. This had a related immunity profile in cows from Thailand, which serovars Tarassovi and Sejroe were prevalent. Development of a vaccine protecting against leptospiral infection in livestock has been considered. One family of proteins being targeted as candidates for vaccine development are leucine-rich repeats (LRRs), which have diverse functions such as bacterial host-pathogen interactions, membrane anchoring, invasion and stimulating host defense mechanisms. Identifying leptospiral LRR proteins containing immunogenic epitopes is important for Leptospirosis vaccine development. In this study, we searched LRR genes from L. borgpetersenii serovar Hardjo-bovis strain L550 and LB179 genomic databases in an attempt to find appropriate LRR proteins for vaccine candidates covering the common genospecies detected in Thailand. The in silico analysis, LRR protein secondary and tertiary structures by 3D modeling, and T cell epitope prediction &amp; analysis were performed. In conclusion, we have found seven pairs of conserved LRR genes in L. borpetersenii serovars Hardjo-bovis strains JB197 and L550. Only the LBJ_2271 gene was predicted to be LRR motif subfamily membrane protein with an N-terminal signal sequence, 2 transmembrane domains and an N-glycosylated site. The LRR consensus sequence LXXLXLXXNXL was classified in a typical LRR subfamily. The LBJ_2271 gene sequence has highly homology to genes in other pathogenic Leptospira interrogans serovars; LA_1324, LIC_12401, JX26069, JX26070, JX26071 and JX06072. The LBJ_2271 protein was predicted to containin 14 T cell epitopes, 8 of which are predicted T cell epitopes for Major-Histo-Compatability (MHC) alleles HLA-A*0101, A*0202, A*0203, A*1101, A*3101, A*6802, and HLA-DRB*0401 and DRB*0701, with IC50 values of 0.90-32.28nM, residing outside of the transmembrane domains. At least 5 promising predicted T cell epitopes for alleles HLA-A0202, -A0203, -A1101, -DRB0401 and -DRB0701 had their IC50 lower - equal to IC50 values for the same allele epitopes of known antigenic proteins LigA, LipL32, OMPL1 and LipL36. This study has successfully identified LBJ_2271 as a protein candidate for further study of antigenic immune stimulation for vaccine development. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={C-to-U RNA editing has been widely observed in organellar RNAs in terrestrial plants. Recent research has revealed the significance of a large, plant-specific family of pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins for RNA editing and other RNA processing events in plant mitochondria and chloroplasts. PPR protein is a sequence-specific RNA-binding protein that identifies specific C residues for editing. Discovery of the RNA recognition code for PPR motifs, including verification and prediction of the individual RNA editing site and its corresponding PPR protein, expanded our understanding of the molecular function of PPR proteins in plant organellar RNA editing. Using this knowledge and the co-expression database, we have identified two new PPR proteins that mediate chloroplast RNA editing. Further, computational target assignment using the PPR RNA recognition codes suggests a distinct, unknown mode-of-action, by which PPR proteins serve a function beyond site recognition in RNA editing. © 2013 Landes Bioscience.},

abstract={It is well recognized that flowering plants maintain a particularly broad spectrum of factors to support gene expression in mitochondria. Many of these factors are pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins that participate in virtually all processes dealing with RNA. One of these processes is the post-transcriptional generation of mature 5′ termini of RNA. Several PPR proteins are required for efficient 5′ maturation of mitochondrial mRNA and rRNA. These socalled RNA PROCESSING FACTORs (RPF) exclusively represent P-class PPR proteins, mainly composed of canonical PPR motifs without any extra domains. Applying the recent PPRnucleotide recognition code, binding sites of RPF are predicted on the 5′ leader sequences. The sequence-specific interaction of an RPF with one or a few RNA substrates probably directly or indirectly recruits an as-yet-unidentified endonuclease to the processing site(s). The identification and characterization of RPF is a major step toward the understanding of the role of 5′ end maturation in flowering plant mitochondria. © 2013 Landes Bioscience.},

abstract={A new member of the WD repeat protein family, named GhWD40, was cloned from a near-isogenic line for glands in cotton. It has 2629 bp cDNA and a complete opening reading frame (ORF) of 1239 bp, containing the initial code (ATG) and terminal code (TAG); there is a 1061 bp non-coding sequence at the 5′-end, and a 329 bp non-coding sequence at the 3′-end, including the poly(A) sequence (accession number: JN714279). The predicted protein of the complete ORF comprised 412 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 47.1 kDa and an isoelectric point of 8.88. Protein domain scanning showed that the novel protein has five wd40 motifs and belongs to the WD40 family. From a search for GhWD40 cDNA and amino acid sequences in the database, it has 77% sequence identity and was 90% sequence positive with the WD-40 repeat protein from Trifolium pratense (accession number BAE71307.1), and 80% sequence identity and 89% sequence positivity with the ribosome biogenesis protein bop1 from Ricinus communis (accession number XP 002529002.1). We propose that GhWD40 may play the same role as bop1. In addition, expression of GhWD40 in near-isogenic lines 11 and 3 (with and without glands, respectively) was studied by quantitative RT-polymerase chain reaction, and the level in near-isogenic line 11 was higher than that in near-isogenic line 3, suggesting that GhWD40 may be related to gland formation. © 2012 Versita Warsaw and Springer-Verlag Wien.},

abstract={Motivation: Repeat proteins form a distinct class of structures where folding is greatly simplified. Several classes have been defined, with solenoid repeats of periodicity between ca. 5 and 40 being the most challenging to detect. Such proteins evolve quickly and their periodicity may be rapidly hidden at sequence level. From a structural point of view, finding solenoids may be complicated by the presence of insertions or multiple domains. To the best of our knowledge, no automated methods are available to characterize solenoid repeats from structure. Results: Here we introduce RAPHAEL, a novel method for the detection of solenoids in protein structures. It reliably solves three problems of increasing difficulty: (1) recognition of solenoid domains, (2) determination of their periodicity and (3) assignment of insertions. RAPHAEL uses a geometric approach mimicking manual classification, producing several numeric parameters that are optimized for maximum performance. The resulting method is very accurate, with 89.5% of solenoid proteins and 97.2% of non-solenoid proteins correctly classified. RAPHAEL periodicities have a Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.877 against the manually established ones. A baseline algorithm for insertion detection in identified solenoids has a Q2 value of 79.8%, suggesting room for further improvement. RAPHAEL finds 1931 highly confident repeat structures not previously annotated as solenoids in the Protein Data Bank records. © 2012 The Author.},

abstract={An F2 population was developed from a cross between a mur-cytoplasmic male sterile broccoli line and a restorer Chinese kale line. Phenotypic analysis of F2 plants indicated that the pollen fertility is controlled by two genes and segregated in a duplicate gene interaction mode with a ratio of 15:1. A total of 236 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers were developed utilizing 1,448 primers designed for production of expressed sequence tag (EST)-SNP markers of Raphanus sativus and analyzed by the dot-blot technique in 205 F2 individuals. A linkage map was constructed with a total of 142 markers and these markers were assigned to nine linkage groups together with simple sequence repeat markers mapped previously on the published linkage maps of Brassica oleracea. The linkage map spanned 909 cM with an average marker distance of 6.4 cM. A fertility restorer locus (Rfm1) was mapped on LG1, corresponding to chromosome 3, along with a flower color locus at a distance of 25 cM. SNP markers flanking the Rfm1 locus were BoCL2642s at a distance of 2.5 cM on one side and BoCL2901s at a distance of 7.5 cM on the other side. All the SNP markers showed homology with Arabidopsis thaliana and Brassica rapa genome sequences. Three pentatricopeptide repeat genes of the P-subfamily, particularly expressed in buds of the restorer line, were identified and these genes could be potential candidate fertility restorer genes. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract={Cellulose synthase (CesA) genes constitute a complex multigene family with six major phylogenetic clades in angiosperms. The recently sequenced genome of domestic apple, Malus-domestica was mined for CesA genes, by blasting full-length cellulose synthase protein (CESA) sequences annotated in the apple genome against protein databases from the plant models Arabidopsis thaliana and Populus trichocarpa. Thirteen genes belonging to the six angiosperm CesA clades and coding for proteins with conserved residues typical of processive glycosyltransferases from family 2 were detected. Based on their phylogenetic relationship to Arabidopsis CESAs, as well as expression patterns, a nomenclature is proposed to facilitate further studies. Examination of their genomic organization revealed that MdCesA8-A is closely linked and co-oriented with WDR53, a gene coding for a WD40 repeat protein. The WDR53 and CesA8 genes display conserved collinearity in dicots and are partially co-expressed in the apple xylem. Interestingly, the presence of a bicistronic WDR53-CesA8A transcript was detected in phytoplasma-infected phloem tissues of apple. The bicistronic transcript contains a spliced intergenic sequence that is predicted to fold into hairpin structures typical of internal ribosome entry sites, suggesting its potential cap-independent translation. Surprisingly, the CesA8A cistron is alternatively spliced and lacks the zinc-binding domain. The possible roles of WDR53 and the alternatively spliced CESA8 variant during cellulose biosynthesis in M.-xdomestica are discussed. © 2012 The Authors.},

abstract={Only a few Armadillo (ARM) repeat proteins have been characterized in plants where they appear to have diverse functions, including the regulation of defence responses. In this study, the identification, cloning and characterization of a gene, encoding an ARM repeat protein (GhARM), is described. GhARM exists as multiple copies in cotton, with an 1713 bp ORF encoding 570 amino acids. The predicted protein contains three consecutive ARM repeats within an Armadillo-type fold, with no other distinguishing domains. Sequence alignments and phylogenetic analysis revealed that GhARM has a high homology with other ARM proteins in plants. The predicted three dimensional model of GhARM displayed a characteristic right-handed superhelical twist. In silico analysis of the promoter sequence revealed that it contains several defence- and hormone-responsive cis-regulatory elements. Expression of GhARM was significantly down-regulated in response to treatment with a V. dahliae elicitor suggesting that GhARM may function as a negative-regulator of cotton defence signalling against V. dahliae.

abstract={Pathogenesis of many bacterially-induced inflammatory diseases is driven by Toll-like receptor (TLR) mediated immune responses following recognition of bacterial factors by different TLRs. Periodontitis is a chronic inflammation of the tooth supporting apparatus often leading to tooth loss, and is caused by a Gram-negative bacterial consortium that includes Tannerella forsythia. This bacterium expresses a virulence factor, the BspA, which drives periodontal inflammation by activating TLR2. The N-terminal portion of the BspA protein comprises a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain previously shown to be involved in the binding and activation of TLR2. The objective of the current study was to identify specific epitopes in the LRR domain of BspA that interact with TLR2. Our results demonstrate that a sequence motif GC(S/T)GLXSIT is involved in mediating the interaction of BspA with TLR2. Thus, our study has identified a peptide motif that mediates the binding of a bacterial protein to TLR2 and highlights the promiscuous nature of TLR2 with respect to ligand binding. This work could provide a structural basis for designing peptidomimetics to modulate the activity of TLR2 in order to block bacterially-induced inflammation. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Genes encoding glycine- and proline-rich proteins (GPRPs) are widely distributed in land plants, but these have been rarely characterised. In this study, a total of six GPRPs (GmGPRP1 to 6) have been identified in the soybean genome database, and full-length complementary DNA and genomic DNA sequences of GmGPRP3 and GmGPRP4 have been cloned. GmGPRP1-6 genes encoded a set of small predicted proteins (<185aa) with molecular mass of 12.35-19.67 kDa and isoelectric point of 6.79-10.22. GmGPRP1-5 contained three exons and two introns with fixed occurring sites, whereas GmGPRP6 only has two exons and one intron. In the deduced GmGPRP1-5 sequences, six amino acids (glycine, proline, histidine, alanine, lysine and tyrosine) account for more than 75% of the total protein composition. GmGPRPs showed high similarity to other known GPRPs at amino acid level. Most of GPRPs had three conserved regions, including an N-terminal XYPP-repeat domain, a central hydrophobic domain containing several uninterrupted alanine residues and a C-terminal HGK-repeat region. The transcripts of GmGPRP1, 3 and 4 appeared in different organs including seedling leaves, stems and roots, flowers and developing seeds, but every gene showed a unique organ-specific expression pattern. Furthermore, the expression of GmGPRP1, 3 and 4 was significantly induced by drought, salt and cold, but repressed by abscisic acid. In silico analysis of promoter regions of these genes revealed the presence of putative abiotic-stress regulatory elements. Our data suggest GmGPRPs encoding a class of conservative XYPP-repeat proteins probably play an important role in plant development as well as in response to abiotic stresses. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={The expressions of chloroplast and mitochondria genes are tightly controlled by numerous nuclear-encoded proteins, mainly at the post-transcriptional level. Recent analyses have identified a large, plant-specific family of pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) motif-containing proteins that are exclusively involved in RNA metabolism of organelle genes via sequence-specific RNA binding. A tandem array of PPR motifs within the protein is believed to facilitate the RNA interaction, although little is known of the mechanism. Here, we describe the RNA interacting framework of a PPR protein, Arabidopsis HCF152. First, we demonstrated that a Pfam model could be relevant to the PPR motif function. A series of proteins with two PPR motifs showed significant differences in their RNA binding affinities, indicating functional differences among PPR motifs. Mutagenesis and informatics analysis putatively identified five amino acids organizing its RNA binding surface [the 1st, 4th, 8th, 12th and 'ii'(-2nd) amino acids] and their complex connections. SELEX (Systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment) and nucleobase preference assays determined the nucleobases with high affinity for HCF152 and suggested several characteristic amino acids that may be involved in determining specificity and/or affinity of the PPR/RNA interaction. © 2011 The Author(s).},

abstract={Correct specification of the left-right (L-R) axis is important for organ morphogenesis. Conserved mechanisms involving cilia rotation inside node-like structures and asymmetric Nodal signaling in the lateral plate mesoderm (LPM), which are important symmetry-breaking events, have been intensively studied. In zebrafish, the clustering and migration of dorsal forerunner cells (DFCs) is critical for the formation of the Kuppfer's vesicle (KV). However, molecular events underlying DFC clustering and migration are less understood. The WD-repeat proteins function in a variety of biological processes, including cytoskeleton assembly, intracellular trafficking, mRNA splicing, transcriptional regulation and cell migration. However, little is known about the function of WD-repeat proteins in L-R asymmetry determination. Here, we report the identification and functional analyses of zebrafish wdr18, a novel gene that encodes a WD-repeat protein that is highly conserved among vertebrate species. wdr18 was identified from a Tol2 transposon-mediated enhancer trap screen. Follow-up analysis of wdr18 mRNA expression showed that it was detected in DFCs or the KV progenitor cells and later in the KV at early somitogenesis stages. Morpholino knockdown of wdr18 resulted in laterality defects in the visceral organs, which were preceded by the mis-expression of Nodal-related genes, including spaw and pitx2. Examination of morphants at earlier stages revealed that the KV had fewer and shorter cilia which are immotile and a smaller cavity. We further investigated the organization of DFCs in wdr18 morphant embryos using ntl and sox17 as specific markers and found that the clustering and migration of DFC was altered, leading to a disorganized KV. Finally, through a combination of wdr18 and itgb1b morpholino injections, we provided evidence that wdr18 and itgb1b genetically interact in the laterality determination process. Thus, we reveal a new and essential role for WD-repeat proteins in the determination and regulation of L-R asymmetry and propose a potential mechanism for wdr18 in the regulation of DFC clustering and migration and KV formation. © 2011 Gao et al.},

abstract={The will die slowly (wds) gene coding for a WD-repeat protein with seven repeats has been characterized in Drosophila melanogaster. In this paper, the wds gene was isolated and characterized from the Chinese oak silkworm, Antheraea pernyi (Lepidoptera: Saturniidae). The obtained 1733 bp cDNA sequence contains an open reading frame of 1041 bp encoding a polypeptide of 346 amino acids, with 85% sequence identity to that from D. melanogaster. RT-PCR analysis showed that the wds gene was transcribed during four developmental stages and in all the tissues tested, consistent with the result observed in Bombyx mori based on EST resources and genome-wide microarray information. The mRNA expression level of the A. pernyi wds gene was not significantly down- or up- regulated under temperature stress compared to the control, indicating that it may be not involved in temperature stress tolerance. In search of database, the wds protein homologues were found in various kinds of eukaryotes, including fungi, plants, invertebrates and vertebrates, with 50-93% amino acid sequence identities between them, suggesting that they are highly conserved during the evolution of eukaryotes. Phylogenetic analysis based on the wds protein homologue sequences clearly separated the known fungi, plants, invertebrates and vertebrates, consistent with the topology tree on the classical systematics, suggesting the potential value of wds protein in eukaryotic phylogenetic inference. In vertebrates, two apparent types of the wds proteins were also defined by sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2010.},

abstract={Isolation and characterization of promoters are important in understanding gene regulation and genetic engineering of crop plants. Earlier, a pentatricopeptide repeat protein (PPR) encoding gene (At2g39230), designated as Lateral Organ Junction (LOJ) gene, was identified through T-DNA promoter trapping in Arabidopsis thaliana. The upstream sequence of the LOJ gene conferred on the reporter gene a novel LOJ-specific expression. The present study was aimed at identifying and characterizing the cis-regulatory motifs responsible for tissue-specific expression in the -673 and +90 bases upstream of the LOJ gene recognized as LOJ promoter. In silico analysis of the LOJ promoter revealed the presence of a few relevant regulatory motifs and a unique feature like AT-rich inverted repeat. Deletion analysis of the LOJ promoter confirmed the presence of an enhancer-like element in the distal region (-673/-214), which stimulates a minimal promoter-like sequence in the -424/-214 region in a position and orientation autonomous manner. The -136/+90 region of the LOJ promoter was efficient in driving reporter gene expression in tissues like developing anthers and seeds of Arabidopsis. A positive regulation for the seed- and anther-specific expression module was contemplated within the 5′ untranslated region of the LOJ gene. However, this function was repressed in the native context by the lateral organ junction-specific expression. The present study has led to the identification of a novel lateral organ junction-specific element and an enhancer sequence in Arabidopsis with potential applications in plant genetic engineering. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={The genes coding for PGYRPs (proline-, glycine-and tyrosine-rich proteins) are widely distributed across eukaryotes and have been proposed to have critical role in plant development, especially in response to environmental stresses. In this study, total of 12 soybean PGYRPs (GmPGYRP1-12) were identified from the soybean genome database for the first time and full-length cDNA and DNA sequences of GmPGYRP7 was cloned. GmPGYRP1-12 genes encoded a set of small predicted proteins (<120 aa) with molecular mass of 7.20-13.29 kDa and isoelectric point of 4.06-6.57. All GmPGYRPs contained three exons and two introns with fixed occurring sites within genomic DNA sequences. In the putative GmPGYRP sequences, 4 amino acids (proline, glycine, tyrosine, and glutamine) account for more than 39% of the total protein composition. GmPGYRPs had a relatively flexible GYPPX motif followed by a highly conserved cysteine-rich domain (GCLAAXCCCCXLXC) and showed high similarity to other known PGYRPs, especially in C-terminal region. Most of PGYRPs can be divided into five subgroups according to phylogenetic analysis. The transcripts of GmPGYRP1, 3, 5, and 7, representing different PGYRP subgroups, appeared in different organs including seedling leaves, stems, roots, flowers, and developing seeds, but mainly accumulated in seedling roots. Furthermore, the expression of GmPGYRP1, 3, 5, and 7 was significantly regulated by drought, salt and cold, but obviously repressed by abscisic acid (ABA) at early stage. Our data suggest that GmPGYRP genes encoding a class of conservative XYPPX-repeat proteins probably play an important role in plant development as well as in response to abiotic stresses. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2010.},

abstract={Chondroadherin is a leucine-rich repeat protein known to mediate adhesion of isolated cells via the integrin α2β1 and to interact with collagen. In this work, we show that cell adhesion to chondroadherin leads to activation of MAPKs but does not result in cell spreading and division. This is in contrast to the spreading and dividing of cells grown on collagen, although the binding is mediated via the same α2β1 receptor. We identified a cell binding motif, CQLRGLRRWLEAK318 by mass spectrometry after protease digestion of chondroadherin. Cells adhering to the synthetic peptide CQLRGLRRWLEAK 318 remained round, as was observed when they bound to the intact protein. The peptide added in solution was able to inhibit cell adhesion to the intact protein in a dose-dependent manner and was also verified to bind to the α2β1 integrin. A cyclic peptide, CQLRGLRRWLEAKASRPDATC326, mimicking the structural constraints of this sequence in the intact protein, showed similar efficiency in inhibiting binding to chondroadherin. The unique peptide motif responsible for cellular binding is primarily located in the octamer sequence LRRWLEAK318. Binding of cells to the active peptide or to chondroadherin immobilized on cell culture plates rapidly induces intracellular signaling (i.e. ERK phosphorylation). Thus, chondroadherin interaction with cells may be central for maintaining the adult chondrocyte phenotype and cartilage homeostasis. The peptides, particularly the more stable cyclic peptide, open new opportunities to modulate cell behavior in situations of tissue pathology. © 2011 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

abstract={In vascular plants, organelle RNAs are edited by C-to-U base modification. Hundreds of mitochondrial C residues are targeted for editing in flowering plants. In this study, we exploited naturally occurring variation in editing extent to identify Required for Efficiency of Mitochondrial Editing1 (REME1), an Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) pentatricopeptide repeat protein-encoding gene belonging to the DYW subclass that promotes editing of at least two C residues on different mitochondrial transcripts. Positional cloning identified REME1 unambiguously as the gene controlling editing of nad2-558. Virus-induced gene silencing of REME1 confirmed its role in editing of nad2-558 and allowed us to identify orfX-552 as a second C whose editing is positively controlled by REME1. An unexpected outcome of REME1 silencing was the finding of a number of mitochondrial C targets whose editing extent exhibits a significant and reproducible increase in silenced tissues. That increase was shown to be partly due to the virus inoculation and partly to REME1-specific silencing. Analysis of an insertional T-DNA mutant within the REME1 coding sequence confirmed the findings of the virus-induced gene silencing experiments: decrease in editing extent of nad2-558 and orfX-552 and increase in editing extent of two sites, matR-1771 and rpl5-92. Transgenic complementation of the low-edited accession (Landsberg erecta) restored the editing of nad2-558 and orfX-552 to high-edited accession (Columbia)-type levels or to even higher levels than Columbia. There was no effect of the transgene on editing extent of matR-1771 and rpl5-92. The strategy and tools used in this report can be applied to identify additional genes that affect editing extent in plant mitochondria.},

abstract={Background: Intragenic tandem repeats occur throughout all domains of life and impart functional and structural variability to diverse translation products. Repeat proteins confer distinctive surface phenotypes to many unicellular organisms, including those with minimal genomes such as the wall-less bacterial monoderms, Mollicutes. One such repeat pattern in this clade is distributed in a manner suggesting its exchange by horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Expanding genome sequence databases reveal the pattern in a widening range of bacteria, and recently among eucaryotic microbes. We examined the genomic flux and consequences of the motif by determining its distribution, predicted structural features and association with membrane-targeted proteins.Results: Using a refined hidden Markov model, we document a 25-residue protein sequence motif tandemly arrayed in variable-number repeats in ORFs lacking assigned functions. It appears sporadically in unicellular microbes from disparate bacterial and eucaryotic clades, representing diverse lifestyles and ecological niches that include host parasitic, marine and extreme environments. Tracts of the repeats predict a malleable configuration of recurring domains, with conserved hydrophobic residues forming an amphipathic secondary structure in which hydrophilic residues endow extensive sequence variation. Many ORFs with these domains also have membrane-targeting sequences that predict assorted topologies; others may comprise reservoirs of sequence variants. We demonstrate expressed variants among surface lipoproteins that distinguish closely related animal pathogens belonging to a subgroup of the Mollicutes. DNA sequences encoding the tandem domains display dyad symmetry. Moreover, in some taxa the domains occur in ORFs selectively associated with mobile elements. These features, a punctate phylogenetic distribution, and different patterns of dispersal in genomes of related taxa, suggest that the repeat may be disseminated by HGT and intra-genomic shuffling.Conclusions: We describe novel features of PARCELs (Palindromic Amphipathic Repeat Coding ELements), a set of widely distributed repeat protein domains and coding sequences that were likely acquired through HGT by diverse unicellular microbes, further mobilized and diversified within genomes, and co-opted for expression in the membrane proteome of some taxa. Disseminated by multiple gene-centric vehicles, ORFs harboring these elements enhance accessory gene pools as part of the "mobilome" connecting genomes of various clades, in taxa sharing common niches. © 2010 Röske et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

In India it causes severe economic losses in black pepper, chillies and cocoa. Towards the understanding of gene function in P. capsici, we undertook the functional annotation of ESTs available at NCBI. A total of 56,457 ESTs were downloaded from NCBI and assembled into 5966 contigs. Functional categorization of these ESTs was performed using database similarity search. By functional analysis, we estimated that 84.73% of transcripts encode significant proteins. The most prominent sequences corresponds to members of metabolic pathways, avirulence-associated protein, beta-tubulin, calcium/calmodulin dependent protein kinase 3, catalase, endo-1, 4-betaglucanase, cyst germination specific acidic repeat protein precursor, elicitin-like protein, glucanase inhibitor protein, heat shock protein, Kazal-like serine protease inhibitor, mitogen-activated protein kinase, ribosomal protein, serine/threonine kinase, syntaxin and ubiquitin.

abstract={Plant innate immunity is mediated in part by resistance (R) proteins that detect pathogens and mount a robust defense response to fight against infection. We previously characterized proteins in the MOS4-associated complex (MAC) that function in the regulation of plant immune responses downstream of the autoactivated R protein snc1. The MAC is a highly conserved spliceosome- associated complex homologous to the nineteen complex (NTC) in yeast and human. The availability of proteomics data sets in these organisms allowed us to systematically test the biological function of additional putative MAC proteins based on protein sequence homology and reverse genetics. In this study, we investigate the function of the GENERAL CONTROL NONDEREPRESSIBLE1 (GCN1) homolog in Arabidopsis. GCN1 was previously isolated as a novel component of the NTC in one proteomics study of the human spliceosome. We identified a single GCN1 homolog in Arabidopsis and partially characterized its function using available T-DNA insertion mutants. This locus, previously named ILITYHIA (ILA), is required for non-host and basal resistance against Pseudomonas syringae as well as resistance conditioned by specific nucleotide binding, leucine-rich repeat (NB-LRR) R proteins. Furthermore, ILA is required for systemic acquired resistance (SAR). Previous proteomic identification of MAC components in Arabidopsis did not identify ILA, and epistasis analysis between snc1 and ila revealed that ILA does not function in snc1-mediated resistance. Overall, our results show that ILA functions in immunity against bacterial infection. © 2010 The Author.},

abstract={The pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) protein family is one of the largest and most complex families in plants. These proteins contain multiple 35-amino acid repeats that are proposed to form a super helix capable of binding RNA. PPR proteins have been implicated in many crucial functions broadly involving organelle biogenesis and plant development. In this study, we identified many genes encoding PPR protein in Upland cotton through an extensive survey of the database of Gossypium hirsutum. Furthermore, we isolated five full-length cDNA of PPR genes from G. hirsutum 0-613-2R which were named GhPPR1-GhPPR5. Domain analysis revealed that the deduced amino acid sequences of GhPPR1-5 contained from 5 to 10 PPR motifs and those PPR proteins were divided into two different PPR subfamilies. GhPPR1-2 belonged to the PLS subfamily and GhPPR3-5 belonged to the P subfamily. Phylogenetic analysis of the five GhPPR proteins and 18 other plant PPR proteins also revealed that the same subfamily clustered together. All five GhPPR genes were differentially but constitutively expressed in roots, stems, leaves, pollens, and fibers based on the gene expression analysis by real-time quantitative RT-PCR.

abstract={In mitochondria of higher plants, the majority of 5′ termini of mature mRNAs are generated posttranscriptionally. To gain insight into this process, we analyzed a natural 5′ end polymorphism in the species Arabidopsis thaliana. This genetic approach identified the nuclear gene At1g62670, encoding a pentatricopeptide repeat protein. The functional importance of this mitochondrial restorer of fertility-like protein, designated RNA PROCESSING FACTOR2 (RPF2), is confirmed by the analysis of a respective T-DNA knockout mutant and its functional restoration by in vivo complementation. RPF2 fulfills two functions: it is required for the generation of a distinct 5′ terminus of transcripts of subunit 9 of the NADH DEHYDROGENASE complex (nad9) and it determines the efficiency of 5′ end formation of the mRNAs for subunit 3 of the CYTOCHROME C OXIDASE (cox3), the latter also being influenced by mitochondrial DNA sequences. Accordingly, recombinant RPF2 protein directly binds to a nad9 mRNA fragment in vitro. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and immunodetection analyses reveal that altered 5′ processing does not influence accumulation of the nad9 and cox3 polypeptides. In accessions C24, Oystese-1, and Yosemite-0, different inactive RPF2 alleles exist, demonstrating the variability of this gene in Arabidopsis. The identification of RPF2 is a major step toward the characterization of 5′ mRNA processing in mitochondria of higher plants. © 2010 American Society of Plant Biologists.},

The bibliography as well as database searches provided evidence that the human proteome contains at least seven centrosomal leucine-rich repeat proteins including CLERC. CLERC and four other centrosomal leucine-rich repeat proteins contain the SDS22-like leucine-rich repeat motifs, whereas the remaining two proteins contain the RI-like and the cysteine-containing leucine-rich repeat motifs. Individual leucine-rich repeat motifs are highly conserved and present in evolutionarily diverse organisms.

abstract={Pathogenic micro-organisms have been suggested to vary the number of intragenic repeats present within secreted or cell membrane/cell wall-associated proteins in order to manipulate host immune responses. We have identified a number of genes predicted to encode secreted proteins possessing internal tandem repeats in the genome sequence of Mycosphaerella graminicola (isolate IPO323), a wheat leaf-specific fungal pathogen and causal agent of Septoria tritici blotch disease. Twenty-three M. graminicola Tandem Repeat Proteins (MgTRPs) were subject to further analysis. Many MgTRPs varied in the number of intragenic repeats between isolates and almost all were expressed. Peak gene expression was frequently observed towards the end of the symptomless phase of wheat leaf colonisation which typically lasts for 8-10 days after inoculation. In contrast, with one exception, increased expression of the majority of MgTRPs was not detected during interactions with resistant host genotypes. Repeat number differences detected in genomic DNA were retained in different transcript sizes produced during plant infection by different isolates. One in planta expressed MgTRP was found to reside within a ∼6 kb region that appears to be absent from a number of tested isolates and also from individual members of a modern field population. Sequence analysis of another in planta expressed MgTRP from six isolates highlighted the potential for structural changes which may occur as a consequence of varying internal repeat numbers and provided support for repeat variation occurring as a consequence of intragenic recombination. These data provide new insights into the genetic variation which exists within M. graminicola populations at the level of in planta expressed secreted/surface-associated proteins which are candidate effectors in the host-pathogen interaction. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={We report the nucleotide sequence of two novel cryptic plasmids (4357 and 14 662 base pairs) carried by a Yersinia enterocolitica biotype 1A strain isolated from pork. As distinguished from most biotype 1A strains, this isolate, designated 07-04449, exhibited adherence to eukaryotic cells. The smaller plasmid pYe4449-1 carries five attributable open reading frames (ORFs) encoding the first CcdA/CcdB-like antitoxin/toxin system described for a Yersinia plasmid, a RepA-like replication initiation protein, and mobilizing factors MobA and MobC. The deduced amino acid sequences showed highest similarity to proteins described in Salmonella (CcdA/B), Klebsiella (RepA), and Plesiomonas (MobA/C) indicating genomic fluidity among members of the Enterobacteriaceae. One additional ORF with unknown function, termed ORF5, was identified with an ancestry distinct from the rest of the plasmid. While the C+G content of ORF5 is 38.3%, the rest of pYe4449-1 shows a C+G content of 55.7%. The C+G content of the larger plasmid pYe4449-2 (54.9%) was similar to that of pYe4449-1 (53.7%) and differed from that of the Y. enterocolitica genome (47.3%). Of the 14 ORFs identified on pYe4449-2, only six ORFs showed significant similarity to database entries. For three of these ORFs likely functions could be ascribed: a TnpR-like resolvase and a phage replication protein, localized each on a low C+G island, and DNA primase TraC. Two ORFs of pYe4449-2, ORF3 and ORF7, seem to encode secretable proteins. Epitope-tagging of ORF3 revealed protein expression at 4°C but not at or above 27°C suggesting adaptation to a habitat outside swine. The hypothetical protein encoded by ORF7 is the member of a novel repeat protein family sharing the DxxGN(x)n DxxGN motif. Our findings illustrate the exceptional gene pool diversity within the species Y. enterocolitica driven by horizontal gene transfer events. Copyright © 2009 Daniela Lepka et al.},

abstract={RPM1 -interacting protein 4 (RIN4), a negative regulator of the basal defense response in plants, is targeted by multiple bacterial virulence effectors. We show that RIN4 degradation is induced by the effector AvrPto from Pseudomonas syringae and that this degradation in Solanaceous plants is dependent on the resistance protein, Pto, a protein kinase, and Prf, a nucleotide binding site-leucine-rich repeat protein. Our data demonstrate overlap between two of the best-characterized pathways for recognition of pathogen virulence effectors in plants. RIN4 interacts with multiple plant signaling components and bacterial effectors in yeast and in planta. AvrPto induces an endogenous proteolytic activity in both tomato [Solanum lycopersicum) and Nicotiana benthamiana that degrades RIN4 and requires the consensus site cleaved by the protease effector AvrRpt2. The interaction between AvrPto and Pto, but not the kinase activity of Pto, is required for proteolysis of RIN4. Analysis of many of the effectors comprising the secretome of P. syringae pv tomato DC3000 led to the identification of two additional sequence-unrelated effectors that can also induce degradation of RIN4. Therefore, multiple bacterial effectors besides AvrRpt2 elicit proteolysis of RIN4 in planta. © 2009 American Society of Plant Biologists.},

abstract={The tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor BZI-1 has been implicated in auxin-mediated gene regulation. Yeast two-hybrid analysis has led to the identification of two BZI-1 protein interaction partners: the heterodimerizing bZIP factor BZI-2 and an ankyrin repeat domain protein, ANK1. Analysis in transgenic plants confirms that low levels of functional BZI-1, BZI-2 and ANK1 result in reduced auxin responses. This finding indicates that the three proteins act in the same functional context. The in vivo interaction of ANK1 and BZI-1 has been confirmed by protoplast two-hybrid analysis, as well as by bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) studies. Whereas YFP-BZI-1 has been found to be localized in the nucleus, YFP-ANK1 resides in the cytosol. Nevertheless, the inhibition of nuclear export with the inhibitor leptomycin B (LMB) and the co-expression with BZI-1, as well as treatment with auxin, results in the accumulation of YFP-ANK1 in the nucleus. Whereas BZI-1 is a weak activator, BZI-1/BZI-2 heterodimers efficiently support transcription. Importantly, conditions that lead to the accumulation of ANK1 in the nucleus, such as the expression of an ANK1 protein fused to a nuclear localization sequence (NLS) or auxin treatment, lead to a significant enhancement of BZI-1/BZI-2-mediated transcription. We therefore propose a mechanism in which the nuclear accumulation of ANK1 enhances BZI-1/BZI-2-mediated transcription in an auxin-dependent manner, presumably facilitated by protein-protein interaction. In summary, this study defines novel components in auxin-dependent signalling and transcriptional control. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Background: The entomopathogenic nematode Heterorhabditis bacteriophora and its symbiotic bacterium, Photorhabdus luminescens, are important biological control agents of insect pests. This nematode-bacterium-insect association represents an emerging tripartite model for research on mutualistic and parasitic symbioses. Elucidation of mechanisms underlying these biological processes may serve as a foundation for improving the biological control potential of the nematode-bacterium complex. This large-scale expressed sequence tag (EST) analysis effort enables gene discovery and development of microsatellite markers. These ESTs will also aid in the annotation of the upcoming complete genome sequence of H. bacteriophora. Results: A total of 31,485 high quality ESTs were generated from cDNA libraries of the adult H. bacteriophora TTO1 strain. Cluster analysis revealed the presence of 3,051 contigs and 7,835 singletons, representing 10,886 distinct EST sequences. About 72% of the distinct EST sequences had significant matches (E value < 1e-5) to proteins in GenBank's non-redundant (nr) and Wormpep190 databases. We have identified 12 ESTs corresponding to 8 genes potentially involved in RNA interference, 22 ESTs corresponding to 14 genes potentially involved in dauer-related processes, and 51 ESTs corresponding to 27 genes potentially involved in defense and stress responses. Comparison to ESTs and proteins of free-living nematodes led to the identification of 554 parasitic nematode-specific ESTs in H. bacteriophora, among which are those encoding F-box-like/WD-repeat protein theromacin, Bax inhibitor-1-like protein, and PAZ domain containing protein. Gene Ontology terms were assigned to 6,685 of the 10,886 ESTs. A total of 168 microsatellite loci were identified with primers designable for 141 loci. Conclusion: A total of 10,886 distinct EST sequences were identified from adult H. bacteriophora cDNA libraries. BLAST searches revealed ESTs potentially involved in parasitism, RNA interference, defense responses, stress responses, and dauer-related processes. The putative microsatellite markers identified in H. bacteriophora ESTs will enable genetic mapping and population genetic studies. These genomic resources provide the material base necessary for genome annotation, microarray development, and in-depth gene functional analysis. © 2009 Bai et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={Effector-triggered immunity provides plants with strong protection from pathogens. However, this response has the potential to be highly deleterious to the host and needs to be tightly controlled. The molecular mechanisms in the plant that regulate the balance between activation and suppression of resistance are not fully understood. Previously, we identified Arabidopsis suppressor of rps4-RLD 1 (srfr1) mutants with enhanced resistance to the bacterial effector AvrRps4. These mutants were recessive and retained full susceptibility to virulent bacteria, suggesting that SRFR1 functions as a negative regulator and that AvrRps4-triggered immunity was specifically enhanced in the mutants. Consistent with this, we show here that the response to flagellin, an elicitor of basal resistance, is unaltered in srfr1-1. In contrast, resistance to AvrRps4 in srfr1-1 requires EDS1, a central regulator of effector-triggered immunity via multiple resistance genes. SRFR1 is a single-copy gene encoding a pioneer tetratricopeptide repeat protein conserved between plants and animals. The SRFR1 tetratricopeptide repeat domain shows sequence similarity to those of transcriptional repressors in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Caenorhabditis elegans. Indeed, a sub-pool of SRFR1 transiently expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana leaf cells localizes to the nucleus. Identification of SRFR1 may therefore provide insight into the regulation of the transcriptional reprogramming that is activated by effector-triggered immunity. © 2008 The Authors.},

abstract={Background: The small leucine-rich repeat proteins and proteoglycans (SLRPs) form an important family of regulatory molecules that participate in many essential functions. They typically control the correct assembly of collagen fibrils, regulate mineral deposition in bone, and modulate the activity of potent cellular growth factors through many signalling cascades. SLRPs belong to the group of extracellular leucine-rich repeat proteins that are flanked at both ends by disulphide-bonded caps that protect the hydrophobic core of the terminal repeats. A capping motif specific to SLRPs has been recently described in the crystal structures of the core proteins of decorin and biglycan. This motif, designated as LRRCE, differs in both sequence and structure from other, more widespread leucine-rich capping motifs. To investigate if the LRRCE motif is a common structural feature found in other leucine-rich repeat proteins, we have defined characteristic sequence patterns and used them in genome-wide searches. Results: The LRRCE motif is a structural element exclusive to the main group of SLRPs. It appears to have evolved during early chordate evolution and is not found in protein sequences from non-chordate genomes. Our search has expanded the family of SLRPs to include new predicted protein sequences, mainly in fishes but with intriguing putative orthologs in mammals. The chromosomal locations of the newly predicted SLRP genes would support the large-scale genome or gene duplications that are thought to have occurred during vertebrate evolution. From this expanded list we describe a new class of SLRP sequences that could be representative of an ancestral SLRP gene. Conclusion: Given its exclusivity the LRRCE motif is a useful annotation tool for the identification and classification of new SLRP sequences in genome databases. The expanded list of members of the SLRP family offers interesting insights into early vertebrate evolution and suggests an early chordate evolutionary origin for the LRRCE capping motif. © 2008 Park et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={The mixed lineage leukemia protein-1 (MLL1) catalyzes histone H3 lysine 4 methylation and is regulated by interaction with WDR5 (WD-repeat protein-5), RbBP5 (retinoblastoma-binding protein-5), and the Ash2L (absent, small, homeotic discs-2-like) oncoprotein. In the accompanying investigation, we describe the identification of a conserved arginine containing motif, called the "Win" or WDR5 interaction motif, that is essential for the assembly and H3K4 dimethylation activity of the MLL1 core complex. Here we present a 1.7-Å crystal structure of WDR5 bound to a peptide derived from the MLL1 Win motif. Our results show that Arg-3765 of MLL1 is bound in the same arginine binding pocket on WDR5 that was previously suggested to bind histone H3. Thermodynamic binding experiments show that the MLL1 Win peptide is preferentially recognized by WDR5. These results are consistent with a model in which WDR5 recognizes Arg-3765 of MLL1, which is essential for the assembly and enzymatic activity of the MLL1 core complex. © 2008 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

abstract={The pyrimidine exchange type of RNA editing in land plant (embryophyte) organelles has largely remained an enigma with respect to its biochemical mechanisms, the underlying specificities, and its raison d'être. Apparently arising with the earliest embryophytes, RNA editing is conspicuously absent in one clade of liverworts, the complex thalloid Marchantiidae. Several lines of evidence suggest that the large gene family of organelle-targeted RNA-binding pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins plays a fundamental role in the sequence-specific editing of organelle transcripts. We here describe the identification of PPR protein genes with plant-specific carboxyterminal (C-terminal) sequence signatures (E, E+, and DYW domains) in ferns, lycopodiophytes, mosses, hornworts, and jungermanniid liverworts, one subclass of the basal most clade of embryophytes, on DNA and cDNA level. In contrast, we were unable to identify these genes in a wide sampling of marchantiid liverworts (including the phylogenetic basal genus Blasia) - taxa for which no RNA editing is observed in the organelle transcripts. On the other hand, we found significant diversity of this type of PPR proteins also in Haplomitrium, a genus with an extremely high rate of RNA editing and a phylogenetic placement basal to all other liverworts. Although the presence of modularly extended PPR proteins correlates well with organelle RNA editing, the now apparent complete loss of an entire gene family from one clade of embryophytes, the marchantiid liverworts, remains puzzling. © The Author 2008.

abstract={Background: Spermatogenesis is comprised of a series of highly regulated developmental changes that transform the precursor germ cell into a highly specialized spermatozoon. The last phase of spermatogenesis, termed spermiogenesis, involves dramatic morphological change including formation of the acrosome, elongation and condensation of the nucleus, formation of the flagella, and disposal of unnecessary cytoplasm. A prominent cytoskeletal component of the developing spermatid is the manchette, a unique microtubular structure that surrounds the nucleus of the developing spermatid and is thought to assist in both the reshaping of the nucleus and redistribution of spermatid cytoplasm. Although the molecular motor KIFC1 has been shown to associate with the manchette, its precise role in function of the manchette and the identity of its testis specific protein partners are unknown. The purpose of this study was to identify proteins in the testis that interact with KIFC1 using a yeast 2 hybrid screen of a testis cDNA library. Results: Thirty percent of the interacting clones identified in our screen contain an identical cDNA encoding a 40 kD protein. This interacting protein has 4 leucine-rich repeats in its amino terminal half and is expressed primarily in the testis; therefore we have named this protein testis leucine-rich repeat protein or TLRR. TLRR was also found to associate tightly with the KIFC1 targeting domain using affinity chromatography. In addition to the leucine-rich repeats, TLRR contains a consensus-binding site for protein phosphatase-1 (PP1). Immunocytochemistry using a TLRR specific antibody demonstrates that this protein is found near the manchette of developing spermatids. Conclusion: We have identified a previously uncharacterized leucine-rich repeat protein that is expressed abundantly in the testis and associates with the manchette of developing spermatids, possibly through its interaction with the KIFC1 molecular motor. TLRR is homologous to a class of regulatory subunits for PP1, a central phosphatase in the reversible phosphorylation of proteins that is key to modulation of many intracellular processes. TLRR may serve to target this important signaling molecule near the nucleus of developing spermatids in order to control the cellular rearrangements of spermiogenesis. © 2008 Wang and Sperry; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={The rapid burgeoning of available protein data makes the use of clustering within families of proteins increasingly important, the challenge is to identify subfamilies of evolutionarily related sequences. This identification reveals phylogenetic relationships, which provide prior knowledge to help researchers understand biological phenomena. A good evolutionary model is essential to achieve a clustering that reflects the biological reality, and an accurate estimate of protein sequence similarity is crucial to the building of such a model. Most existing algorithms estimate this similarity using techniques that are not necessarily biologically plausible, especially for hard-to-align sequences such as multi-domain, circular-permutation and tandem-repeats protein sequences, which cause many difficulties for the alignment-dependent algorithms. In this paper, we propose a novel similarity measure based on matching amino acid subsequences. This measure, named SMS for Substitution Matching Similarity, is especially designed for application to non-aligned protein sequences. It allows us to develop a new alignment-independent algorithm, named CLUSS, for clustering protein families. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first alignment-free algorithm for clustering protein sequences. Unlike other clustering algorithms, CLUSS is effective on both alignable and non-alignable protein families. ©2007 IEEE.},

abstract={We isolated many genes induced from pepper cDNA microarray data following their infection with the soybean pustule pathogen Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. glycines 8ra. A full-length cDNA clone of the Capsicum annuum ankyrin-repeat domain C3H1 zinc finger protein (CaKR1) was identified in a chili pepper using the expressed sequence tag (EST) database. The deduced amino acid sequence of CaKR1 showed a significant sequence similarity (46%) to the ankyrin-repeat protein in very diverse family of proteins of Arabidopsis. The gene was induced in response to various biotic and abiotic stresses in the pepper leaves, as well as by an incompatible pathogen, such as salicylic acid (SA) and ethephon. CaKR1 expression was highest in the root and flower, and its expression was induced by treatment with agents such as NaCl and methyl viologen, as well as by cold stresses. These results showed that CaKR1 fusion with soluble, modified green fluorescent protein (smGFP) was localized to the cytosol in Arabidopsis protoplasts, suggesting that CaKR1 might be involved in responses to both biotic and abiotic stresses in pepper plants.},

abstract={Increasing efforts are being invested in the construction of nanostructures with desired shapes and physical and chemical properties. Our strategy involves nanostructure design using naturally occurring protein building blocks. Inspection of the protein structural database (PDB) reveals the richness of the conformations, shapes, and chemistries of proteins and their building blocks. To increase the population of the native fold in the selected building block, we mutate natural residues by engineered, constrained residues that restrict the conformational freedom at the targeted site and have favorable interactions, geometry, and size. Here, as a model system, we construct nanotubes using building blocks from left-handed β-helices which are commonly occurring repeat protein architectures. We pick two-turn β-helical segments, duplicate and stack them, and using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations (MD) with explicit solvent probe the structural stability of these nanotubular structures as indicated by their capacity to retain the initial organization and their conformational dynamics. Comparison of the results for the wild-type and mutated sequences shows that the introduction of the conformationally restricted 1-aminocyclopropanecarboxylic acid (Ac3c) residue in loop regions greatly enhances the stability of β-helix nanotubes. The Ac3c geometrical confinement effect is sequence-specific and position-specific. The achievement of high stability of nanotubular structures originates not only from the reduction of mobility at the mutation site induced by Ac3c but also from stabilizing association forces between building blocks such as hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts. For the selected synthetic residue, similar size, hydrophobicity, and backbone conformational tendencies are desirable as in the Ac3c. © 2007 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={To gain a better insight on the molecular regulation of apple (Malus × domestica Borkh. cv 'Mondial Gala') fruit ripening, the mRNA Differential Display technique coupled with silver-staining was used with success as a method to identify and isolate cDNAs representing transcripts differentially expressed during this developmental process. Using 25 primer combinations and three populations of mRNA (samples from unripe but fully expanded fruits, from fruits at harvest and from overripe fruits), a total of 927 bands were obtained, of which 14 non-redundant cDNAs were confirmed to be up-regulated during apple ripening, after elimination of false-positives by RT-PCR (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) expression studies. DNA sequence analyses of the clones identified revealed significant homology to known plant genes and proteins reported in public databases, namely a 14-3-3 protein, a zinc-finger protein, a lipoxygenase, a flavonol synthase, a WD-40 repeat protein, a protein disulphide isomerase, an l-allo-threonine aldolase, an anthranilate N-hydroxycinnamoyl/benzoyltransferase, an homologue to a phototropic-response protein, a known apple allergen (Mal d1), two CTP synthase clones, an IAA-amidohydrolase and a calcium-binding EF hand protein. These proteins can be associated to biological processes like lipid metabolism, secondary metabolism, signal transduction, gene transcription and RNA metabolism, stress responses or defense. Still, for some of the clones, this is the first report in which they are associated with ripening. Even so, the homology found with previously described proteins allows disclosing possible biochemical roles for the proteins putatively encoded by these gene families and their putative significance in apple ripening is discussed. The results provide a contribution to better characterise the changes in gene expression that accompanies the ripening process in apple; a specie which lacks information about the molecular regulation of ripening. © 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

abstract={We are interested in the problem of grouping families of non-alignable protein sequences, such as circular-permutation, multidomain and tandem-repeat proteins, into clusters (classes) of related biological functions. For such sequences, whose numbers are constantly growing, the commonly used alignment-dependent approaches fail to yield biologically plausible results. To the best of our knowledge, no automatic process yet exists to carry out clustering on these proteins. Biologists often use more complex manual approaches based on secondary and tertiary structures, which require considerably more resources and time. In this paper, we develop a new similarity measure SMS, applied directly on non-aligned sequences. It allows us to develop a new and original alignment-free algorithm, named CLUSS, for clustering protein families based on a spectral decomposition approach inspired by the latent semantic analysis (LSA) widely used in information retrieval. CLUSS, utilized jointly with SMS, is effective on both alignable and non-alignable protein sequences. To show this, we have extensively tested our algorithm on different benchmark protein databases and families; we have also compared its performance with many alignment-dependent mainstream algorithms. The source code, the application server, and all experimental results are available at CLUSS web site http://prospectus.usherbrooke.ca/CLUSS/.},

abstract={Solenoid proteins, which are distinguished from general globular proteins by their modular architectures, are frequently involved in signal transduction pathways. Proteins from the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) and Sel1-like repeat (SLR) families share similar α-helical conformations but different consensus sequence lengths and superhelical topologies. Both families are characterized by low sequence similarity levels, rendering the identification of functional homologous difficult. Therefore current knowledge of the molecular and cellular functions of the SLR proteins Sel1, Hrd3, Chs4, Nif1, PodJ, ExoR, AlgK, HcpA, Hsp12, EnhC, LpnE, MotX, and MerG has been reviewed. Although SLR proteins possess different cellular functions they all seem to serve as adaptor proteins for the assembly of macromolecular complexes. Sel1, Hrd3, Hsp12 and LpnE are activated under cellular stress. The eukaryotic Sel1 and Hrd3 proteins are involved in the ER-associated protein degradation, whereas the bacterial LpnE, EnhC, HcpA, ExoR, and AlgK proteins mediate the interactions between bacterial and eukaryotic host cells. LpnE and EnhC are responsible for the entry of L. pneumophila into epithelial cells and macrophages. ExoR from the symbiotic microorganism S. melioti and AlgK from the pathogen P. aeruginosa regulate exopolysaccaride synthesis. Nif1 and Chs4 from yeast are responsible for the regulation of mitosis and septum formation during cell division, respectively, and PodJ guides the cellular differentiation during the cell cycle of the bacterium C. crescentus. Taken together the SLR motif establishes a link between signal transduction pathways from eukaryotes and bacteria. The SLR motif is so far absent from archaea. Therefore the SLR could have developed in the last common ancestor between eukaryotes and bacteria. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={A new class of organellar proteins, characterized by pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) motifs, has been identified in plants. These proteins contain multiple 35-amino acid repeats that are proposed to form a super helix capable of binding a strand of RNA. All PPR proteins characterized to date appear to be involved in RNA processing pathways in organelles. Twenty-three PPR proteins have been identified in Trypanosoma brucei and database research indicates that most of these proteins are predicted to contain the traditional mitochondrial target sequence. Orthologues of each of the 23 proteins have also been identified in Leishmania major and Trypanosoma cruzi, indicating that these proteins represent a highly conserved class of proteins within the kinetoplastid family. Preliminary experiments using RNAi to specifically silence one identified PPR gene (TbPPRl- Tb927.2.3180), indicate that cells depleted of TbPPRl transcripts show a slow growth phenotype and altered mitochondrial maxicircle RNA profiles. This initial characterization suggests that PPR proteins will play important roles in the complex RNA processing required for mitochondrial gene expression in trypanosomes. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={In the unicellular eukaryotic green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii , several circadian rhythms have been physiologically well characterised. Recently, the entire nuclear, chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes of this alga have been sequenced, and about 200 000 expressed sequence tags have been created. Therefore, functional proteomics of the circadian system has been initiated and has resulted in the identification of novel components of the circadian system (a protein disulfide isomerase and a tetratricopeptide repeat protein). Furthermore, comparative analysis of the C. reinhardtii genome with known clock-related genes from other model organisms reveals that some photoreceptors and especially clock-related kinases and phosphatases are well conserved in C. reinhardtii . Several circadian expressed genes have been identified in C. reinhardtii , whose temporal expression is controlled at the transcriptional level. Also, a circadian RNA-binding protein (CHLAMY 1) has been characterised. It represents a novel type of RNA-binding protein and mediates circadian control at the post-transcriptional level. Its circadian binding activity appears to be controlled by differential multi-protein complexes. © 2006 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={Kettin is a large actin-binding protein with immunoglobulin-like (Ig) repeats, which is associated with the thin filaments in arthropod muscles. Here, we report identification and functional characterization of kettin in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We found that one of the monoclonal antibodies that were raised against C. elegans muscle proteins specifically reacts with kettin (Ce-kettin). We determined the entire cDNA sequence of Ce-kettin that encodes a protein of 472 kDa with 31 Ig repeats. Arthropod kettins are splice variants of much larger connectin/titin-related proteins. However, the gene for Ce-kettin is independent of other connectin/titin-related genes. Ce-kettin localizes to the thin filaments near the dense bodies in both striated and nonstriated muscles. The C-terminal four Ig repeats and the adjacent non-Ig region synergistically bind to actin filaments in vitro. RNA interference of Ce-kettin caused weak disorganization of the actin filaments in body wall muscle. This phenotype was suppressed by inhibiting muscle contraction by a myosin mutation, but it was enhanced by tetramisole-induced hypercontraction. Furthermore, Ce-kettin was involved in organizing the cytoplasmic portion of the dense bodies in cooperation with α-actinin. These results suggest that kettin is an important regulator of myofibrillar organization and provides mechanical stability to the myofibrils during contraction. © 2006 by The American Society for Cell Biology.},

abstract={The broad-spectrum rice blast resistance gene Pi9 was cloned using a map-based cloning strategy. Sequencing of a 76-kb bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) contig spanning the Pi9 locus led to identification of six tandemly arranged resistance-like genes with a nucleotide-binding site (NBS) and leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) (Nbs1-Pi9-Nbs6-Pi9). Analysis of selected Pi9 deletion mutants and transformation of a 45-kb fragment from the BAC contig into the susceptible rice cultivar TP309 narrowed down Pi9 to the candidate genes Nbs2-Pi9 and Nbs3-Pi9. Disease evaluation of the transgenic lines carrying the individual candidate genes confirmed that Nbs2-Pi9 is the Pi9 gene. Sequence comparison analysis revealed that the six paralogs at the Pi9 locus belong to four classes and gene duplication might be one of the major evolutionary forces contributing to the formation of the NBS-LRR gene cluster. Semiquantitative reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR analysis showed that Pi9 was constitutively expressed in the Pi9-resistant plants and was not induced by blast infection. The cloned Pi9 gene provides a starting point to elucidate the molecular basis of the broadspectrum disease resistance and the evolutionary mechanisms of blast resistance gene clusters in rice.

abstract={Based on sequence similarity search and domain detection, nine ACT domain repeat protein-coding genes (the "ACR" genes) in rice were identified, which were mainly distributed on the chromosomes 2, 3, 4, and 8. An InterPro database search indicated that four copies of the ACT domain linearly occupied the entire polypeptide. The first three ACT domains were linked by two different sequences. However, the fourth ACT domain was extremely close to ACT3. Gene structure comparisons showed large differences in exon numbers, from three to eight, among members of the rice ACR gene family. In addition, it appeared that gene duplication might be operative when the compositions of exons and introns were analyzed. Phylogenetic analysis divided the ACR gene family into five distinct groups, and this division was generally according to the expression patterns of the ACR genes. The Arabidopsis and rice ACR proteins were clustered across together, suggesting that these ACR genes might originate from an ancient common ancestor. Notably, the identification of orthologues and paralogues would be useful for rice gene functional annotation. © 2005 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.},

The structures indeed reveal unusual, nonglobular structures, a linear "string" of the tandem motifs. Perhaps because of the large surface area that is presented as a consequence of such elongated structures, repeat domains are often involved in mediating protein-protein interactions. Here we udescribe methods of consensus-based design and engineering of repeat proteins. We pay particular attention to the attributes of repeat proteins that make them well-suited to such approaches. In addition, we discuss practical issues related to producing and characterizing such designed proteins.

abstract={In higher plants, RNA editing is a posttranscriptional process that converts C to U in organelle mRNAs. Although RNA editing in mitochondria occurs much more frequently than in chloroplasts, editing of exogenously supplied RNA substrates in vitro and in organello has shown that editing in the two organelles shares some common features. In particular, the 20 nucleotides upstream of the editing site play an important role in specifying the C to be edited. Biochemical approaches have allowed the identification of features of cis-sequences necessary for KNA editing to occur, but have failed to identify any of the components of the mitochondrial editing machinery. In order to implement a genetic approach for identification of editing factors, we have identified a polymorphism in the editing efficiency of a mitochondrial site between two ecotypes of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), Columbia (Col) and Landsberg erecta (Ler). In rosette leaves, an editing site within the ccb206 mitochondrial gene is more highly edited in Col than in Ler. Depending on the development stage and tissue analyzed, the difference in editing extent varies between the two ecotypes; for example, in floral buds, editing extent does not differ. Single-point regression analysis of the editing efficiency in a sample of recombinant inbred lines derived from a cross between Col and Ler allowed the identification of two quantitative trait loci controlling this trait. A member of the pentatricopeptide repeat protein family that carries a putative mitochondrial transit sequence has been identified near a major quantitative trait locus on chromosome 4. © 2005 American Society of Plant Biologists.},

abstract={Eighteen human histone deacetylases (HDACs) have been identified, and according to their sequence similarity to yeast homologs, these enzymes are grouped into distinct classes. Within class II, HDAC4, HDAC5, HDAC7, and HDAC9 share similar domain organization both within the N-terminal extension and the C-terminal catalytic domain, thus forming a subclass known as class IIa. These HDACs function as signal-responsive transcriptional corepressors. To gain further insight into their function and regulation, we utilized an N-terminal fragment of HDAC4 as bait in yeast two-hybrid screens, which uncovered myocyte enhancer factor 2C, 14-3-3ζ, and ankyrin repeat family A protein (ANKRA). ANKRA is a poorly characterized protein with an ankyrin repeat domain similar to RFXANK, a subunit of the trimeric transcription factor RFX. Mutations on genes of the RFX subunits and the coactivator CIITA are responsible for the bare lymphocyte syndrome, an immunodeficiency disorder attributed to the lack of major histocompatibility complex class II (MHCII) antigens. Through its ankyrin repeat domain, RFXANK interacted with HDAC4. Two RFXANK-binding sites were found on HDAC4 with one located within residues 118-279 and another within residues 448-666. Interestingly, this deacetylase also interacted with CIITA. Consistent with the physical interaction with RFXANK and CIITA, HDAC4 and homologs repressed MHCII expression. These results identify ANKRA, RFXANK, and CIITA as novel targets of class IIa HDACs and suggest that these deacetylases play a role in regulating MHCII expression. © 2005 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

abstract={Despite recent progress, the precise mechanisms responsible for vertebrate cardiac development are still enigmatic. Better understanding of cardiac biology and disease necessitates identification and analysis of a full spectrum of regulatory and structural proteins specific to the developing heart. By performing an in silico screen, we identified a cardiac-specific gene we named Serdin1. The Serdin1 gene is conserved, and the message is restricted to the heart in several vertebrate species, thus implicating Serdin1 as an important gene in cardiac development. In situ hybridization confirmed that the Serdin1 message is cardiac-specific in mice as early as embryonic day 8.5. Antibody staining demonstrated predominantly nuclear staining in immortalized cardiac cell lines (P19 and HL-1) and proliferating cultured cardiomyocytes, whereas in vivo SERDIN1 localizes to I bands of the sarcomere. Seven kilobases of the upstream regulatory sequence of Serdin1 is sufficient for cardiac-specific expression. Computer analysis revealed an 80-bp homologous region between the mouse and the human Serdin genes that contains GATA, SRF, and MEF sites. Cardiac specificity and localization patterns suggest that SERDIN1 is intimately integrated with the molecular pathways controlling cardiogenesis in vertebrates. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract={We report the protein isolation, cloning and characterization of members of an unusual protein family, which comprise the most abundant proteins present in the squid eye. The proteins in this family have a range of molecular weights from 32 to 36 kDa. Electron microscopy and detergent solubilization demonstrate that these proteins are tightly associated with membrane structures where they may form tetramers. Despite this, these proteins have no stretches of hydrophobic residues that could form typical transmembrane domains. They share an unusual protein sequence rich in methionine, and contain multiple repeating motifs. We have therefore named these proteins Methionine-Rich Repeat Proteins (MRRPs). The use of structure prediction algorithms suggest very little recognized secondary structure elements. At the time of cloning no sequence or structural homologues have been found in any database. We have isolated three closely related cDNA clones from the MRRP family. Coupled in vitro transcription/translation of the MRRP clones shows that they encode proteins with molecular masses similar to components of native MRRPs. Immunoblot analysis of these proteins reveals that they are also present in squid brain, optic lobe, and heart, and also indicate that MRRP-like protein motifs may also exist in mammalian tissues. We propose that MRRPs define a family of important proteins that have an unusual mode of attachment or insertion into cell membranes and are found in evolutionarily diverse organisms. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression in animals and plants. Comparative genomic computational methods have been developed to predict new miRNAs in worms, flies, and humans. Here, we present a novel single genome approach for the detection of miRNAs in Arabidopsis thaliana. This was initiated by producing a candidate miRNA-target data set using an algorithm called findMiRNA, which predicts potential miRNAs within candidate precursor sequences that have corresponding target sites within transcripts. From this data set, we used a characteristic divergence pattern of miRNA precursor families to select 13 potential new miRNAs for experimental verification, and found that corresponding small RNAs could be detected for at least eight of the candidate miRNAs. Expression of some of these miRNAs appears to be under developmental control. Our results are consistent with the idea that targets of miRNAs encompass a wide range of transcripts, including those for F-box factors, ubiquitin conjugases, Leucine-rich repeat proteins, and metabolic enzymes, and that regulation by miRNAs might be widespread in the genome. The entire set of annotated transcripts in the Arabidopsis genome has been run through findMiRNA to yield a data set that will enable identification of potential miRNAs directed against any target gene. © 2005 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.},

abstract={A large gene family encoding proteins with a pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) motif exists in flowering plants but not in algae, fungi, or animals. This suggests that PPR protein genes expanded vastly during the evolution of the land plants. To investigate this possibility, we analysed PPR protein genes in the basal land plant, the moss Physcomitrella patens. An extensive survey of the Physcomitrella expressed sequence tag (EST) databases revealed 36 ESTs encoding PPR proteins. This indicates that a large gene family of PPR proteins originated before the divergence of the vascular plant and moss lineages. We also characterized five full-length cDNAs encoding PPR proteins, designated PPR513-10, PPR566-6, PPR868-14, PPR986-12, and PPR423-6. Intracellular localization analysis demonstrated two PPR proteins in chloroplasts (cp), whereas the cellular localization of the other three PPR proteins is unclear. The genes of the cp-localized PPR513-10 and PPR566-6 were expressed differentially in protonemata grown under different light-dark conditions, suggesting they have distinctive functions in cp.

abstract={The rice (Oryza sativa) spotted leaf11 (spl11) mutant was identified from an ethyl methanesulfonate-mutagenized indica cultivar IR68 population and was previously shown to display a spontaneous cell death phenotype and enhanced resistance to rice fungal and bacterial pathogens. Here, we have isolated Spl11 via a map-based cloning strategy. The isolation of the Spl11 gene was facilitated by the identification of three additional spl11 alleles from an IR64 mutant collection. The predicted SPL11 protein contains both a U-box domain and an armadillo (ARM) repeat domain, which were demonstrated in yeast and mammalian systems to be involved in ubiquitination and protein-protein interactions, respectively. Amino acid sequence comparison indicated that the similarity between SPL11 and other plant U-box-ARM proteins is mostly restricted to the U-box and ARM repeat regions. A single base substitution was detected in spl11, which results in a premature stop codon in the SPL11 protein. Expression analysis indicated that Spl11 is induced in both incompatible and compatible rice-blast interactions. In vitro ubiquitination assay indicated that the SPL11 protein possesses E3 ubiquitin ligase activity that is dependent on an intact U-box domain, suggesting a role of the ubiquitination system in the control of plant cell death and defense. © 2004 American Society of Plant Biologists.},

abstract={Complement control proteins (CCPs) contain repeated protein domains, short consensus repeats (SCRs), which must be relevant to diverse functions such as complement activation, coagulation, viral binding, fetal implantation, and self-non-self recognition. Although SCRs share some discontinuous and imperfect motifs, there are many variable positions and indels making classification in subfamilies extremely difficult. Using domain-by-domain phylogenetic analysis, we have found that most domains can be classified into only 11 subfamilies, designated a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, or k and identified by critical residues. Each particular CCP is characterized by the order of representatives of the subfamilies. Human complement receptor 1 (CR1) has ajefbkd repeated four times and followed by ch. The classification crosses CCPs and indicates that a particular CCP is a function of the mix of SCRs. The aje set is a feature of several CCPs including human CR1 and DAF and murine Crry and appears to be associated with the success or failure of implantation inter alia. This approach facilitates genomic analysis of available sequences and suggests a framework for the evolution of CCPs. Units of duplication range from single SCRs, to septamers such as efbkdaj, to extensive segments such as MCP-CR1L. Imperfections of duplication with subsequent deletion have contributed to diversification.},

We determined the crystal structure of Caenorhabditis elegans AIP1 (UNC-78), which revealed 14 WD40 modules arranged in two seven-bladed β-propeller domains. The structure allowed for the mapping of conserved surface residues, and mutagenesis studies identified five residues that affected the ADF/cofilin-dependent actin filament disassembly activity. Mutations of these residues, which reside in blades 3 and 4 in the N-terminal propeller domain, had significant effects on the disassembly activity but did not alter the barbed end capping activity. These data support a model in which this conserved surface of AIP1 plays a direct role in enhancing fragmentation/depolymerization of ADF/cofilin-bound actin filaments but not in barbed end capping.},

The three complexes did not form (a) with double-stranded DNA and the C-rich telomeric strand, (b) in competition assays using specific telomeric DNA oligonucleotides, or (c) after pretreatment with proteinase K. LaGT1 was the most specific and did not bind a Tetrahymena telomeric sequence. All three LaGTs associated with an RNA sequence cognate to the telomeric G-rich strand and a complex similar to LaGT1 is formed with a double-stranded DNA bearing a 3′ G-overhang tail. The protein components of LaGT2 and LaGT3 were purified by affinity chromatography and identified, after renaturation, as ≈ 35 and ≈ 52 kDa bands, respectively. The ≤ 15 kDa protein component of LaGT1 was gel-purified as a UV cross-linked complex of ≈ 18-20 kDa. Peptides generated from trypsin digestion of the affinity and gel-purified protein bands were analysed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ ionization-time of flight and electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry.

Characterization of the folding and assembly pathways suggests that ankyrin repeat domains generally undergo a two-state folding transition despite their modular structure. Also, the large number of available sequences has allowed the ankyrin repeat to be used as a template for consensus-based protein design. Such projects have been successful in revealing positions responsible for structure and function in the ankyrin repeat as well as creating a potential universal scaffold for molecular recognition.},

abstract={Multiple and variable tyrosine sulfation in extracellular class II leucine-rich repeat proteins/proteoglycans were characterized by mass spectrometry. The sulfogroup on tyrosine is labile and is released from peptides under normal mass spectrometric conditions. Thus, special approaches must be considered in order to identify this modification. By using a combination of mass spectrometry studies operating in negative and positive ion mode, tyrosine sulfation could be identified. In positive mode, the peptides normally appeared non-sulfated, whereas in negative mode a mixture of sulfated and non-sulfated species was observed. A combination of peptides released by different proteinases was used to obtain details on the locations of sulfate groups. Multiple tyrosine sulfates were observed in the N-terminal region of fibromodulin (up to 9 sites), osteoadherin (up to 6 sites), and lumican (2 sites). Osteoadherin contains two additional sulfated tyrosine residues close to its C terminus. We also identified an error in the published sequence of bovine fibromodulin, resulting in the replacement of Thr37 by Tyr37-Gly38, thus increasing its homology with its human counterpart.},

abstract={Longitudinal bone growth results from coordination of proliferation and hypertrophy of chondrocytes, calcification of the matrix, vascular invasion, and completion of endochondral bone formation in the growth plate. Although proliferative and hypertrophic chondrocytes are well characterized histomorphologically, the understanding of factors governing this transition is not fully explained. Our hypothesis was that significant differential gene expression exists between proliferative and hypertrophic chondrocytes that may provide clues to the regulation of this transition at the transcriptional level. Normal Sprague-Dawley rat growth plate chondrocytes from the proliferative zone (PZ) and hypertrophic zone (HZ) were isolated by laser capture microdissection and then subjected to microarray analysis. Confirmation of the differential expression of selected genes was done by in situ hybridization and quantitative reverse transcription (RT) polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A total of 40 transcripts showed at least twofold fgreater expression in the PZ compared to HZ at both 6 and 7 weeks of age, while 52 transcripts showed twofold greater expression in the HZ compared to PZ at these time points. Many of the differentially expressed genes in each zone had very high levels of expression and thus were classified as "enriched transcripts" for that zone. The PZ-enriched transcripts included fibromodulin, proline arginine-rich end leucine-rich repeat protein, lactate dehydrogenase, and enolase 1 alpha. In contrast, HZ-enriched transcripts included collagen I, protein kinase (lysine deficient 4), proteasome (prosome, macropain) activator subunit 4, prostaglandin I2 synthase, and integrin-binding sialoprotein, matrix metalloproteinase 13 (MMP13), and collagen X. Other genes were highly expressed in cells from both zones, including collagen II, aggrecan, cartilage oligomeric protein, cartilage link protein, laminin receptor, and eukaryotic translocation elongation factor. Functional classification of the PZ-enriched transcripts showed an increased percentage of genes expressed in nuclear cell cycle and transcription functions. In contrast, the HZ-enriched transcripts were more involved in extracellular structure and membrane receptor and transporter functions. Pathway analysis indicated that transforming growth factor β and parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) pathways were important in both zones, and bone morphogenic protein pathway played a role in the HZ. It is likely that these differentially expressed genes are involved in regulation of the transition from proliferation to differentiation functions in the growth plate. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={The origin and evolution of the thousands of species-specific genes with unknown functions, the so-called orphan genes, has been a mystery. Here, we have studied the rates and patterns of orphan sequence evolution, using the Rickettsia as our reference system. Of the Rickettsia conorii orphans examined in this study, 80% were found to be short gene fragments or fusions of short segments from neighboring genes. We reconstructed the putative sequences of the full-length genes from which the short orphan fragments are thought to have originated. One of the genes thus reconstructed displays weak similarity to the ankyrin-repeat protein family, an identification that is strongly supported by comparative molecular modeling. Studies of the patterns of gene fragmentation underscore the importance of short repeated sequences as targets for recombination events that result in sequence loss and the formation of short, transient open reading frames. Our analysis demonstrates that gene sequences present in the common ancestor can be inferred even in cases when no full-length open reading frame is present in any of the contemporary species. Such reconstructions support the identification of lost protein functions and hint at important lifestyle changes. © Society for Molecular Biology and Evolution 2003; all rights reserved.},

abstract={Background: The kelch motif is an ancient and evolutionarily-widespread sequence motif of 44-56 amino acids in length. It occurs as five to seven repeats that form a β-propeller tertiary structure. Over 28 kelch-repeat proteins have been sequenced and functionally characterised from diverse organisms spanning from viruses, plants and fungi to mammals and it is evident from expressed sequence tag, domain and genome databases that many additional hypothetical proteins contain kelch-repeats. In general, kelch-repeat β -propellers are involved in protein-protein interactions, however the modest sequence identity between kelch motifs, the diversity of domain architectures, and the partial information on this protein family in any single species, all present difficulties to developing a coherent view of the kelch-repeat domain and the kelch-repeat protein superfamily. To understand the complexity of this superfamily of proteins, we have analysed by bioinformatics the complement of kelch-repeat proteins encoded in the human genome and have made comparisons to the kelch-repeat proteins encoded in other sequenced genomes. Results: We identified 71 kelch-repeat proteins encoded in the human genome, whereas 5 or 8 members were identified in yeasts and around 18 in C. elegans, D. melanogaster and A. gambiae. Multiple domain architectures were identified in each organism, including previously unrecognised forms. The vast majority of kelch-repeat domains are predicted to form six-bladed β-propellers. The most prevalent domain architecture in the metazoan animal genomes studied was the BTB/ kelch domain organisation and we uncovered 3 subgroups of human BTB/kelch proteins. Sequence analysis of the kelch-repeat domains of the most robustly-related subgroups identified differences in β-propeller organisation that could provide direction for experimental study of protein-binding characteristics. Conclusion: The kelch-repeat superfamily constitutes a distinct and evolutionarily-widespread family of β-propeller domain-containing proteins. Expansion of the family during the evolution of multicellular animals is mainly accounted for by a major expansion of the BTB/kelch domain architecture. BTB/kelch proteins constitute 72 % of the kelch-repeat superfamily of H. sapiens and form three subgroups, one of which appears the most-conserved during evolution. Distinctions in propeller blade organisation between subgroups 1 and 2 were identified that could provide new direction for biochemical and functional studies of novel kelch-repeat proteins. © 2003 Prag and Adams; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={Synaptic plasticity is important for formation of long-term memories and in re-establishment of function following injury. Seven cDNAs enriched following lesion in the hippocampus of the rat have been isolated using a PCR-based cDNA suppression subtraction hybridization. Sequence analysis resulted in the identification of two genes with known roles in synaptic development and neuronal activities: astrotactin and calcineurin. These two neuron-specific genes have established roles in development or synaptogenesis. Sequence analysis of the other five additional genes shows that two are likely to be involved in G-protein signaling pathways, one is a WD repeat protein, and the remaining two are entirely novel. All seven candidates are expressed in the hippocampus and, in some cases, cortical layers of adult brains. RT-PCR data show that expression increases following synaptogenic lesion. Immunocytochemical analysis in primary hippocampal neurons showed that Calcineurin immunoreactivity was redistributed in neurons during 2 weeks in culture. This redistribution suggests that Calcineurin's role changes during neurite outgrowth immediately prior to synapse formation in vitro. In addition, inhibiting Calcineurin activity with cyclosporin A enhanced neurite outgrowth, suggesting that Calcineurin has a regulatory role in axon sprouting. The discovery of previously unknown genes involved in the response to neurodegeneration will contribute to our understanding of neural development, responses to CNS trauma, and neurodegenerative diseases. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Purified rice (Oryza sativa) mitochondrial proteins have been arrayed by isoelectric focusing/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), by blue-native (BN) PAGE, and by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (LC) separation (LC-mass spectrometry [MS]). From these protein arrays, we have identified a range of rice mitochondrial proteins, including hydrophilic/hydrophobic proteins (grand average of hydropathicity = -1.27 to +0.84), highly basic and acid proteins (isoelectric point = 4.0-12.5), and proteins over a large molecular mass range (6.7-252 kD), using proteomic approaches. BN PAGE provided a detailed picture of electron transport chain protein complexes. A total of 232 protein spots from isoelectric focusing/PAGE and BN PAGE separations were excised, trypsin digested, and analyzed by tandem MS (MS/MS). Using this dataset, 149 of the protein spots (the products of 91 nonredundant genes) were identified by searching translated rice open reading frames from genomic sequence and six-frame translated rice expressed sequence tags. Sequence comparison allowed us to assign functions to a subset of 85 proteins, including many of the major function categories expected for this organelle. A further six spots were matched to rice sequences for which no specific function has yet been determined. Complete digestion of mitochondrial proteins with trypsin yielded a peptide mixture that was analyzed directly by reverse-phase LC via organic solvent elution from a C-18 column (LC-MS). These data yielded 170 MS/MS spectra that matched 72 sequence entries from open reading frame and expressed sequence tag databases. Forty-five of these were obtained using LC-MS alone, whereas 28 proteins were identified by both LC-MS and gel-based separations. In total, 136 nonredundant rice proteins were identified, including a new set of 23 proteins of unknown function located in plant mitochondria. We also report the first direct identification, to our knowledge, of PPR (pentatricopeptide repeat) proteins in the plant mitochondrial proteome. This dataset provides the first extensive picture, to our knowledge, of mitochondrial functions in a model monocot plant.},

abstract={The identification of antigens mediating tumor rejection is an important goal of cancer immunology. The SEREX technology utilizes antibodies from cancer patients to identify candidate antigens from tumor-derived cDNA expression libraries. Using sera from a long-term surviving metastatic melanoma patient vaccinated with irradiated, autologous tumor cells engineered to secrete granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), we identified an antigen reported to be a putative opioid growth factor receptor (OGFr). The human immune response to OGFr exhibits three features shared with other tumor antigens. First, the protein is an intracellular antigen found in both nucleus and cytoplasm. Second, part of the antibody response is directed at a putative protein product encoded by an alternative reading frame (ARF). Third, part of the antibody response is directed at a portion of the molecule that bears a striking resemblance to the extracellular domain of MUC1, both with respect to primary structure and size polymorphism. Antibody responses to OGFr and a synthetic peptide representing a putative alternative reading frame product (OGFr-ARF) were frequently found in cancer patients. 11/45 (24%) melanoma patients had antibodies to OGFr and 5/45 (11%) had antibodies to OGFr-ARF. Moreover, 5/24 (21%) lung cancer, 4/25 (16%) prostate cancer, and 5/6 breast or ovarian cancer patients had antibodies to OGFr, the alternative frame product, or both. These data add to the growing list of tumor antigens that appear to be translated in two frames, and suggest that OGFr and OGFr-ARF may be useful targets for vaccination.},

abstract={Axonemes are highly organized microtubule-based structures conserved in many eukaryotes. In an attempt to study axonemes by a proteomics approach, we selectively cloned cDNAs of axonemal proteins by immunoscreening the testis cDNA library from the ascidian Ciona intestinalis by using an antiserum against whole axonemes. We report here a 37-kDa protein of which cDNA occurred most frequently among total positive clones. This protein, named LRR37, belongs to the class of SDS22+ leucine-rich repeat (LRR) family. LRR37 is different from the LRR outer arm dynein light chain reported in Chlamydomonas and sea urchin flagella, and thus represents a novel axonemal LRR protein. Immunoelectron microscopy by using a polyclonal antibody against LRR37 showed that it is localized on the tip of the radial spoke, most likely on the spoke head. The LRR37 protein in fact seems to form a complex together with radial spoke protein 3 in a KI extract of the axonemes. These results suggest that LRR37 is a component of the radial spoke head and is involved in the interaction with other radial spoke components or proteins in the central pair projection.},

abstract={The light chain 1 (LC1) polypeptide is a member of the leucine-rich repeat protein family and binds at or near the ATP hydrolytic site within the motor domain of the γ heavy chain from Chlamydomonas outer arm dynein. It consists of an N-terminal helix, a central barrel formed from six leucine-rich repeats that fold ββα units, and a C-terminal helical domain that protrudes from the main axis defined by the leucine-rich repeats. Interaction with the γ heavy chain is likely mediated through a hydrophobic patch on the larger β sheet face, and the C-terminal region is predicted to insert into the dynein ATP hydrolytic site. Here we have used 1H-15N heteronuclear relaxation measurements obtained at 500 and 600 MHz to refine and validate the LC1 solution structure. In this refined structure, the C-terminal helix is significantly reoriented by more than 20° as compared to the control and provides a more precise understanding of the potential regulatory role of this domain. We also employed the refined structure to perform a dynamic analysis of LC1 using the 600 MHz data set. These results, which were cross validated using the 500 MHz data set, strongly support identification of the predicted LC1 binding surfaces and provide additional insight into the interaction mechanisms of leucine-rich repeat proteins.},

abstract={Recent studies in humans have highlighted the importance of a distinct cellular entity, the plasmacytoid dendritic cell (PDC). To identify genes for which expression is restricted to human PDCs, a cDNA subtraction technique was applied using cDNA from activated monocyte-derived DCs (MDDCs) as competitor. In the 650 sequences analyzed, 25% were for B-cell transcripts. We also found lymphoid-related genes, immunoglobulinlike transcript 7 (ILT7), granzyme B (GrB), Spi-B, and the receptor tyrosine kinase Eph-Bl. Granzyme B was up-regulated on activation, and protein was detected only in PDCs. Eph-B1 protein was expressed in the cytoplasm and the nuclei of PDCs and MDDCs, respectively. Interestingly, several novel molecules have been identified that were predicted to encode for a type 2 transmembrane protein (BRI3), a putative cytokine (C-15, a cysteine-rich-secreted protein), and a type 1 leucine-rich repeat protein (MAPA). The identification of genes expressed in PDCs provides new insights into their function and origin. © 2002 by The American Society of Hematology.},

abstract={Muskelin was identified in vertebrates as a novel, intracellular, kelch repeat protein that is needed in cell-spreading responses to the matrix adhesion molecule, thrombospondin-1. The identification and characterization of an orthologue of muskelin in Drosophila melanogaster is now reported. The Drosophila muskelin gene, located on chromosome 2R, is encoded in ten exons. Drosophila muskelin is expressed in embryos, larvae and adult flies. The protein has 45% sequence identity to vertebrate muskelins, with highest sequence identity in an amino-terminal domain and the six kelch repeats that form a β-propeller structure. Multiple sequence alignment of human, mouse, rat and Drosophila muskelins and protein database searches revealed a novel highly conserved motif within the amino-terminal domain, lissencephaly homology motif (LisH) and C-terminal to LisH motifs in the central region of the molecule, and several conserved consensus motifs for phosphorylation by protein kinase C and casein kinase II. These findings provide new information on the modular structure of muskelin and indicate potential for conserved mechanisms of function. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={A strategy of mutagenesis followed by yeast two-hybrid assay was used to determine the sites on the WD-repeat protein Receptor for Activated C Kinase 1 (RACK1) necessary for it to interact with the cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase isoform PDE4D5. Analysis of deletion mutations demonstrated that WD-repeats 5-7, inclusively, of RACK1 contained the major site for interaction with PDE4D5. A reverse two-hybrid screen focusing on WD-repeats 5-7 of RACK1 isolated 11 single amino acid mutations from within this region that blocked the interaction. The ability of these mutations to block the interaction was confirmed by "pull-down" assays using bacterially expressed glutathione-S-transferase (GST)-RACK1 and mammalian cell-expressed PDE4D5. A model of RACK1 structure, based on the structural similarity of RACK1 to other β-propeller WD-repeat proteins, indicated that the majority of the amino acids identified by mutagenesis are clustered in a discrete surface of RACK1. We propose that this surface of RACK1 is the major site for its interaction with the unique amino-terminal region of PDE4D5. © 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.},

abstract={ARM and HEAT motifs are tandemly repeated sequences of approximately 50 amino acid residues that occur in a wide variety of eukaryotic proteins. An exhaustive search of sequence databases detected new family members and revealed that at least 1 in 500 eukaryotic protein sequences contain such repeats. It also rendered the similarity between ARM and HEAT repeats, believed to be evolutionarily related, readily apparent. All the proteins identified in the database searches could be clustered by sequence similarity into four groups: canonical ARM-repeat proteins and three groups of the more divergent HEAT-repeat proteins. This allowed us to build improved sequence profiles for the automatic detection of repeat motifs. Inspection of these profiles indicated that the individual repeat motifs of all four classes share a common set of seven highly conserved hydrophobic residues, which in proteins of known three-dimensional structure are buried within or between repeats. However, the motifs differ at several specific residue positions, suggesting important structural or functional differences among the classes. Our results illustrate that ARM and HEAT-repeat proteins, while having a common phylogenetic origin, have since diverged significantly. We discuss evolutionary scenarios that could account for the great diversity of repeats observed. © 2001 Academic Press.},

abstract={Asporin, a novel member of the leucine-rich repeat family of proteins, was partially purified from human articular cartilage and meniscus. Cloning of human and mouse asporin cDNAs revealed that the protein is closely related to decorin and biglycan. It contains a putative propeptide, 4 amino-terminal cysteines, 10 leucine-rich repeats, and 2 C-terminal cysteines. In contrast to decorin and biglycan, asporin is not a proteoglycan. Instead, asporin contains a unique stretch of aspartic acid residues in its amino-terminal region. A polymorphism was identified in that the number of consecutive aspartate residues varied from 11 to 15. The 8 exons of the human asporin gene span 26 kilobases on chromosome 9q31.1-32, and the putative promoter region lacks TATA consensus. sequences. The asporin mRNA is expressed in a variety of human tissues with higher levels in osteoarthritic articular cartilage, aorta, uterus, heart, and liver. The deduced amino acid sequence of asporin was confirmed by mass spectrometry of the isolated protein resulting in 84% sequence coverage. The protein contains an N-glycosylation site at Asn281 with a heterogeneous oligosaccharide structure and a potential O-glycosylation site at Ser54. The name asporin reflects the aspartate-rich amino terminus and the overall similarity to decorin.},

abstract={Synechocystis PCC6803 possesses several open reading frames encoding putative WD-repeat proteins. One, the Hat protein, is involved in the control of a high-affinity transport system for inorganic carbon that is active when the cells are grown under a limiting concentration of this carbon substrate. The protein is composed of two major domains separated by a hydrophobic linker region of 20 amino acid residues. The N-terminal domain of Hat has no homolog in standard databases and does not display any particular structural features. Eleven WD repeats have been identified in the C-terminal moiety. The region encompassing the four terminal WD repeats is essential for growth under a limiting inorganic carbon regime. The region encompassing the two most terminal WD repeats is required for the activity of the high-affinity transport system. However, because the Hat protein is located in the thylakoids, it should not be itself an element of the transport system. The structural organization of the WD-containing domain of Hat was modeled from the crystal structure of the G protein β subunit (with seven WD repeats) and of hemopexin (a structural analog with four blades). Functional and structural data argue in favor of an organization of the Hat WD moiety in two subdomains of seven and four WD repeats. The C-terminal 4-mer subdomain might interact with another, yet unknown, protein/peptide. This interaction could be essential in modulating the stability of the 4-mer structure and, thus, the accessibility of this subdomain, or at least of the region encompassing the last two WD repeats.},

Arpp protein is composed of 333 amino acids and contains four ankyrin-like repeat motifs in the middle portion of the protein, a PEST-like sequence and a lysine-rich sequence similar to a nuclear localization signal in the N-terminal region, and a proline-rich region containing consensus phosphorylation sites in the C-terminal region. Protein sequence analysis revealed that Arpp is homologous (52.7% identity) to Carp which is shown to be involved in the regulation of the transcription of the cardiac ventricular myosin light chain 2 gene. Arpp mRNA was found to be expressed in normal skeletal and cardiac muscle. Interestingly, Arpp expression was detectable in bilateral ventricles, but undetectable in bilateral atria and large vessels, suggesting that Arpp may play a specific function in cardiac ventricles as well as skeletal muscles. © 2001 Academic Press.},

In particular, correlations between the amino acid composition and the ability to fold in a unique structure, as well as classification of the structures based on their repeat length, are described. This analysis suggests rules that can be used for the structural prediction of repeat-containing proteins. The paper is focused on prediction and modeling of solenoid-like proteins with the repeat length ranging between 5 and 40 residues.

abstract={Determination of the structures of fibroblast growth factors and interleukin-1s has previously revealed that they both adopt a β-trefoil fold, similar to those found in Kunitz soybean trypsin inhibitors, ricin-like toxins, plant agglutinins and hisactophilin. These families possess distinct functions and occur in different subcellular localisations, and they appear to lack significant similarities in their sequences, ligands and modes of ligand binding. We have analysed the significance of sequence identities observed after structure alignment and provide statistical evidence that these β-trefoil proteins are all homologues, having arisen from a common ancestor. In addition, we have explored the sequence space of all β-trefoil proteins and have determined that the actin-binding proteins fascins, and other proteins of unknown function, are β-trefoil family homologues. Unlike other β-trefoil proteins, the triplicated repeats in each of the four β-trefoil domains of fascins are significantly similar in sequence. This hints at how the β-trefoil fold arose from the duplication of an ancestral gene encoding a homotrimeric single-repeat protein. The combined analysis of structure and sequence databases for detecting significant similarities is suggested as a highly sensitive approach to determining the common ancestry of extremely divergent homologues.

abstract={The zebrafish, Danio rerio, has three types of pigment cells (melanophores, xanthophores and iridophores) and, in adult fish, these cells are organized into a stripe pattern. The mechanisms underlying formation of the stripe pattern are largely unknown. We report here the identification and characterization of a novel dominant zebrafish mutation, hagoromo (hag), which was generated by insertional mutagenesis using a pseudotyped retrovirus. The hag mutation caused disorganized stripe patterns. TWO hag mutant alleles were isolated independently and proviruses were located within the fifth intron of a novel gene, which we named hag, encoding an F-box/WD40-repeat protein. The hag gene was mapped to linkage group (LG)13, close to fgf8 and pax2.1. Amino acid sequence similarity, conserved exon-intron boundaries and conserved synteny indicated that zebrafish hag is an ortholog of mouse Dactylin, the gene mutated in the Dactylaplasia (Dac) mouse. The Dac mutation is dominant and causes defects in digit formation in fore- and hindlimbs. This study revealed that the hag locus is important for pattern formation in fish but is involved in distinct morphogenetic events in different vertebrates.},

TBLASTN searches of the dbEST databases revealed sequences with a high level of similarity to DmX in a variety of different species, including insects, nematodes, and mammals showing that DmX is an evolutionarily highly conserved gene. Here we describe the cloning of the cDNA and the chromosomal localization of one of the human homologues of DmX, Dmx-like 1 (DMXL1). The human DMXL1 gene codes for a large mRNA of 11 kb with an open reading frame of 3027 amino acids. The putative protein belongs to the superfamily of WD repeat proteins, which have mostly regulatory functions. The DMXL1 protein contains an exceptionally large number of WD repeat units. The DMXL1 gene is located on chromosome 5q22 as determined by radiation hybrid mapping and fluorescence in situ hybridization. Although the function of the DMXL1 gene and its homologues in other species remains to be discovered, the high level of evolutionary conservation together with the unusual structure suggests that it probably has an important function.

Peptide sequences obtained from this component were used as a basis for the cloning (from human retinal cDNA) and sequencing of a novel member of the leucine- rich repeat extracellular matrix protein family that we have named opticin. Opticin mRNA was found by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction in ligament and skin as well as in retina. An open reading frame containing 332 amino acids was identified, the first 19 amino acids representing a signal peptide. The deduced amino acid sequence of the mature protein encodes a 35- kDa protein with a calculated isoelectric point of 5.4. The central domain of this protein consists of six B-type leucine-rich repeats. This domain is flanked by cysteine clusters including a C-terminal two-cysteine cluster containing an additional leucine-rich repeat. The N-terminal region contains a cluster of potential O-glycosylation sites, and analysis of bovine vitreous opticin demonstrated the presence of sialylated O-linked oligosaccharides substituting the core protein. Opticin shows highest protein sequence identity to epiphycan (42%) and osteoglycin (35%) and belongs to Class III of the leucine-rich repeat extracellular matrix protein family.},

abstract={A novel testis-specific protein, termed LRTP, was identified by screening both human and mouse testis and mouse pachytene spermatocyte cDNA libraries. Sequence analyses (GenBank accession number: AF092208) revealed that LRTP contains an amino terminus leucine-rich repeat domain. There are several acidic regions rich in glutamic acid in the C-terminus. The sequence, by GenBank search, shows similarities to LANP and SDS22+, leucine-rich repeat proteins localized to the nucleus and involved in the regulation of protein phosphatases. In mouse, the mRNA is first detected at about Day 14 postpartum, presumably when mid-pachytene spermatocytes are first seen. In situ hybridization confirmed the expression of the LRTP mRNA at this stage of spermatogenesis. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the protein is most abundant in the cytoplasm of pachytene and diplotene cells, corresponding to late prophase of meiosis I. Immunohistochemical localization is markedly reduced in secondary spermatocytes, suggesting a functional association of LRTP with meiosis. An LRTP cDNA probe did not bind to mouse ovary RNA in a dot blot assay.},

abstract={The Drosophila gene ten-m is the first pair-rule gene not encoding a transcription factor, but an extracellular protein. We have characterized a highly conserved chicken homologue that we call teneurin-1. The C-terminal part harbors 26 repetitive sequence motifs termed YD-repeats. The YD-repeats are most similar to the core of the rhs elements of Escherichia coli. Related repeats in toxin A of Clostridium difficile are known to bind specific carbohydrates. We show that recombinantly expressed proteins containing the YD-repeats of teneurin-1 bind to heparin. Furthermore, heparin lyase treatment of extracts of cells expressing recombinant YD-repeat protein releases this protein from high molecular mass aggregates. In situ hybridization and immunostaining reveals teneurin-1 expression in neurons of the developing visual system of chicken and Drosophila. This phylogenetic conservation of neuronal expression from flies to birds implies fundamental roles for teneurin-1 in neurogenesis. This is supported by the neurite outgrowth occurring on substrates made of recombinant YD-repeat proteins, which can be inhibited by heparin. Database searches resulted in the identification of ESTs encoding at least three further members of the teneurin family of proteins. Furthermore, the human teneurin-1 gene could be identified on chromosome Xq24/25, a region implied in an X-linked mental retardation syndrome.},

abstract={We report here that Hap1p (originally named Cyp1p) has an essential function in anaerobic or heme-deficient growth. Analysis of intragenic revertants shows that this function depends on the amino acid preceding the first cysteine residue of the DNA-binding domain of Hap1p. Selection of recessive extragenic suppressors of a hap1-hem1- strain allowed the identification, cloning, and molecular analysis of ASC1 (Cyp1 Absence of growth Supressor). The sequence of ASC1 reveals that its ORF is interrupted by an intron that shelters the U24 snoRNA. Deletion of the intron, inactivation of the ORF, and molecular localization of the mutations show unambiguously that it is the protein and not the snoRNA that is involved in the suppressor phenotype. ASC1, which is constitutively transcribed, encodes an abundant, cytoplasmically localized 35-kD protein that belongs to the WD repeat family, which is found in a large variety of eucaryotic organisms. Polysome profile analysis supports the involvement of this protein in translation. We propose that the absence of functional Asc1p allows the growth of hap1-hem1- cells by reducing the efficiency of translation. Based on sequence comparisons, we discuss the possibility that the protein intervenes in a kinase-dependent signal transduction pathway involved in this last function.},

abstract={The U1 snRNP functions to nucleate spliceosome assembly on newly transcribed pre-mRNA. Saccharomyces cerevisiae is unusual among eukaryotes in the greatly extended length of its U1 snRNA and the apparent increased polypeptide complexity of the corresponding U1 snRNP. In this paper, we report the identification of a novel U1 snRNP protein, Prp42p, with unexpected properties. Prp42p was identified by its surprising structural similarity to the essential U1 snRNP protein, Prp39p. Both Prp39p and Prp42p possess multiple copies of a variant tetratricopeptide repeat, an element implicated in a wide range of protein assembly events. Yeast strains depleted of Prp42p by transcriptional repression of a GAL1::PRP42 fusion gene arrest for Splicing prior to pre-mRNA 5' splice site cleavage. Prp42p was not observed in a recent biochemical analysis of purified U1 snRNPs from S. cerevisiae (28). Nevertheless, antibodies directed against an epitope-tagged version of Prp42p specifically precipitate U1 snRNA from yeast extracts. Furthermore, Prp42p is required for U1 snRNP biogenesis, because yeast strains depleted of Prp42p formed incomplete U1 snRNPs that failed to produce stable complexes with pre-mRNA in vitro. The evidence shows that Prp39p and Prp42p are both required to configure the atypical yeast U1 snRNP into a structure compatible with its evolutionarily conserved role in pre-mRNA splicing.},

abstract={In vivo, nucleosomes are formed rapidly on newly synthesized DNA after polymerase passage. Previously, a protein complex from human cells, termed chromatin assembly factor-I (CAF-I), was isolated that assembles nucleosomes preferentially onto SV40 DNA templates that undergo replication in vitro. Using a similar assay, we now report the purification of CAF-I from the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Amino acid sequence data from purified yeast CAF-I led to identification of the genes encoding each subunit in the yeast genome data base. The CAC1 and CAC2 (chromatin assembly complex) genes encode proteins similar to the p150 and p60 subunits of human CAF-I, respectively. The gene encoding the p50 subunit of yeast CAF-I (CAC3) is similar to the human p48 CAF-I subunit and was identified previously as MSI1, a member of a highly conserved subfamily of WD repeat proteins implicated in histone function in several organisms. Thus, CAF-I has been conserved functionally and structurally from yeast to human cells. Genes encoding the CAF-I subunits (collectively referred to as CAC genes) are not essential for cell viability. However, deletion of any CAC gene causes an increase in sensitivity to ultraviolet radiation, without significantly increasing sensitivity to gamma rays. This is consistent with previous biochemical data demonstrating the ability of CAF-I to assemble nucleosomes on templates undergoing nucleotide excision repair. Deletion of CAC genes also strongly reduces silencing of genes adjacent to telomeric DNA; the CAC1 gene is identical to RLF2 (Rap1p localization factor-2), a gene required for the normal distribution of the telomere-binding Rap1p protein within the nucleus. Together, these data suggest that CAF-I plays a role in generating chromatin structures in vivo.},

To begin a molecular analysis of these components, we generated central apparatus-defective mutants in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii using insertional mutagenesis. One paralyzed mutant recovered in our screen contains an allele of a previously identified mutation, pf20. Mutant cells have paralyzed flagella, and the entire central apparatus is missing in isolated axonemes. We have cloned the wild-type PF20 gene and confirmed its identity by rescuing the pf20 mutant phenotype upon transformation. Rescued transformants were wild type in motility and in axonemal ultrastructure. A cDNA clone containing a single, long open reading frame was obtained and sequenced. Database searches using the predicted 606-amino acid sequence of PF20 indicate that the protein contains five contiguous WD repeats. These repeats are found in a number of proteins with diverse cellular functions including β-transducin and dynein intermediate chains. An antibody was raised against a fusion protein expressed from the cloned cDNA. Immunogold labeling of wild-type axonemes indicates that the PF20 protein is localized along the length of the C2 microtubule on the intermicrotubule bridges connecting the two central microtubules. We suggest that the PF20 gene product is a new member of the family of WD repeat proteins and is required for central microtubule assembly and/or stability and flagellar motility.},

abstract={The plakoglobin/armadillo multigene family comprises many proteins widely differing in sizes and functions which have in common a variable number of tandemly repeated arm sequences of about 42 amino acids (aa). In a search for proteins with sequence homology to the desmosomal-plaque-associated arm-repeat-containing protein, plakophilin 1, we have identified a novel plakoglobin/armadillo protein. This new member of the multigene family is predominantly, if not exclusively, expressed in neural and neuroendocrine tissues, hence the name neural plakophilin-related arm-repeat protein (NPRAP). The murine cDNA codes for a protein of 1247 aa, with a predicted molecular weight of 135 kDa and a pI of 7.57. The orthologous human protein differs only in a few aa, indicative of the evolutinary stability of NPRAP. In human and murine cDNAs, we have found different transcripts of the NPRAP gene, suggesting that in each species the protein exists in at least two isoforms. The NPRA protein contains three different regions: a 528-aa amino-terminal 'head' domain, including a potential coiled-coil-forming ex-helix segment, a central domain with 10 imperfect arm-repeat units, and a 212-aa carboxy-terminal 'tail' domain. By aa sequence, NPRAP is highly homologous to three proteins: p120(cas), p0071 and ARVCF; which represent a distinct subgroup within the plakoglobin/armadillo family. By in situ hybridisation and immunofluorescence microscopy using NPRAP-specific antibodies, we have demonstrated NPRAP and its mRNA in the perikarya of various kinds of CNS neurons in embryonic and adult mice, but minimal amounts have also been detected by immunoblot analysis in some other tissues containing neural or neuroendocrine elements. We have not seen significant enrichment of NPRAP at cell junctions or in nuclei. Possible NPRAP functions are discussed and the correlation of NPRAP synthesis with neuronal differentiation processes is emphasized.},

abstract={Profilins bind to monomeric actin and also interact with ligands such as phosphoinositide 4,5-bisphosphate, the proline-rich protein VASP and a complex of four to six polypeptides identified in Acanthamoeba that includes two actin-related proteins. Here, we report the identification and characterization of an essential gene from Schizosaccharomyces pombe, sop2+, a mutation in which rescues the temperature-sensitive lethality of a profilin mutation, cdc3-124. The sop2-l mutant is defective for cell elongation and septation, suggesting that it is involved in multiple cortical actin-requiring processes. Consistent with a role in actin cytoskeletal function, negative interactions have been identified between sop2-l and act1-48, a mutant allele of actin. Sop2p is a novel 377 amino acid polypeptide with similarity to proteins of the β-transducin repeat family. Sop2p-related proteins have been identified by sequencing projects in diverse species, and we have isolated a human cDNA highly related to sop2 +, SOP2 Hs, which functionally complements the sop2-l mutation. Sop2p proteins from all species contain peptide sequences identical or highly similar to two peptide sequences from an Acanthamoeba β-transducin repeat protein present in the profilin binding complex. Biochemical analyses demonstrate that Sop2p is present in a complex which also contains the actin-related protein, Arp3p. Immunofluorescence studies reveal the presence of Sop2p in (i) punctate structures distributed throughout the cell, (ii) cables that extend the length of the cell, and (iii) a medial band in a small percentage of septating cells. Collectively these data demonstrate the interaction of Sop2p with Arp3p, profilin and actin.},

abstract={The full-length cDNA clone which encodes a novel 824-amino acid protein was characterized. The predicted protein contains ten 34-amino acid repeats characteristic of the tetratricopeptide repeat protein family. The sequence homology and organization of the 10 repeats are similar to those of the nuc2 protein of fission yeast and bimA protein of Aspergillus, which suggests that the newly identified protein could be the human homologue of nuc2 (H-NUC). Consistent with this notion, the M(r) 95,000 H-NUC is a nuclear protein with DNA binding activity. This protein binds to hypophosphorylated Rb protein in a region indistinguishable from that to which SV40 large T antigen binds. However, Rb also binds to H-NUC at the tetratricopeptide repeat motif, a region which contains sequences different from the binding motifs of either T-antigen or E2F-1. To mimic the temperature-sensitive mutant of yeast nuc2, an H-NUC mutant was made in which the highly conserved glycine 640 residue was changed to aspartic acid. In contrast to wild-type H-NUC, the mutant was temperature sensitive in binding to Rb protein. These results, taken together, suggest that the interaction between H-NUC and Rb may be significant.},

abstract={We report the identification of a previously unknown gene, inIA, which is necessary for the gram-positive intracellular pathogen Listeria monocytogenes to invade cultured epithelial cells. The inIA region was localized by transposon mutagenesis, cloned, and sequenced. inIA was introduced into Listeria innocua and shown to confer on this normally noninvasive species the ability to enter cells. Sequencing of inIA predicts an 80 kd protein, internalin. Two-thirds of internalin is made up of two regions of repeats, region A and region B, and the C-terminus of the molecule is similar to that of surface proteins from gram-positive cocci. Internalin has a high content of threonine and serine residues, and the repeat motif of region A has regularly spaced leucine residues. As evidenced by Southern blot analysis, inIA is part of a gene family. One of them is the gene situated directly downstream of inIA, called inIB, which also encodes a leucine-rich repeat protein. © 1991.},
