Abstract = {{Recombinant therapeutic proteins are playing an ever-increasing role in
   the clinic. High-affinity binding candidates can be produced in a
   high-throughput manner through the process of selection and evolution
   from large libraries, but the structures of the complexes with target
   protein can only be determined for a small number of them in a costly,
   low-throughput manner, typically by x-ray crystallography. Reliable
   modeling of complexes would greatly help to understand their mode of
   action and improve them by further engineering, for example, by
   designing bi-paratopic binders. Designed ankyrin repeat proteins
   (DARPins) are one such class of antibody mimetics that have proven
   useful in the clinic, in diagnostics and research. Here we have
   developed a standardized procedure to model DARPin-target complexes that
   can be used to predict the structures of unknown complexes. It requires
   only the sequence of a DARPin and a structure of the unbound target. The
   procedure includes homology modeling of the DARPin, modeling of the
   flexible parts of a target, rigid body docking to ensembles of the
   target and docking with a partially flexible backbone. For a set of
   diverse DARPin-target complexes tested it generated a single model of
   the complex that well approximates the native state of the complex. We
   provide a protocol that can be used in a semi-automated way and with
   tools that are freely available. The presented concepts should help to
   accelerate the development of novel bio-therapeutics for scaffolds with
   similar properties. Crown Copyright (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Protein O-glycosylation is an important post-translational modification
   in all organisms, but deciphering the specific functions of these
   glycans is difficult due to their structural complexity. Understanding
   the glycosylation of mucin-like proteins presents a particular challenge
   as they are modified numerous times with both the enzymes involved and
   the glycosylation patterns being poorly understood. Here we
   systematically explored the O-glycosylation pathway of a mucin-like
   serine-rich repeat protein PsrP from the human pathogen Streptococcus
   pneumoniae TIGR4. Previous works have assigned the function of 3 of the
   10 glycosyltransferases thought to modify PsrP, GtfA/B, and Gtf3 as
   catalyzing the first two reactions to form a unified disaccharide core
   structure. We now use in vivo and in vitro glycosylation assays combined
   with hydrolytic activity assays to identify the glycosyltransferases
   capable of decorating this core structure in the third and fourth steps
   of glycosylation. Specifically, the full-length GlyE and GlyG proteins
   and the GlyD DUF1792 domain participate in both steps, whereas
   full-length GlyA and the GlyD GT8 domain catalyze only the fourth step.
   Incorporation of different sugars to the disaccharide core structure at
   multiple sites along the serine-rich repeats results in a highly
   polymorphic product. Furthermore, crystal structures of apo- and
   UDP-complexed GlyE combined with structural analyses reveal a novel
   Rossmann-fold ``add-on{''} domain that we speculate to function as a
   universal module shared by GlyD, GlyE, and GlyA to forward the peptide
   acceptor from one enzyme to another. These findings define the complete
   glycosylation pathway of a bacterial glycoprotein and offer a testable
   hypothesis of how glycosyltransferase coordination facilitates glycan
   assembly.}},

Abstract = {{Pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins comprise a large family of
   helical repeat proteins that influence gene expression in mitochondria
   and chloroplasts. PPR tracts can bind RNA via a modular one repeat-one
   nucleotide mechanism in which the nucleotide is specified by the
   identities of several amino acids in each repeat. This mode of
   recognition, the so-called PPR code, offers opportunities for the
   prediction of native PPR binding sites and the design of proteins to
   bind specified RNAs. However, a deep understanding of the parameters
   that dictate the affinity and specificity of PPR-RNA interactions is
   necessary to realize these goals. We report a comprehensive analysis of
   the sequence specificity of PPR10, a protein that binds similar RNA
   sequences of similar to 18 nucleotides (nt) near the chloroplast atpH
   and psaJ genes in maize. We assessed the contribution of each nucleotide
   in the atpH binding site to PPR10 affinity in vitro by analyzing the
   effects of single-nucleotide changes at each position. In a
   complementary approach, the RNAs bound by PPR10 from partially
   randomized RNA pools were analyzed by deep sequencing. The results
   revealed three patches in which nucleotide identity has a major impact
   on binding affinity. These include 5 nt for which protein contacts were
   not observed in a PPR10-RNA crystal structure and 4 nt that are not
   explained by current views of the PPR code. These findings highlight
   aspects of PPR-RNA interactions that pose challenges for binding site
   prediction and design.}},

   The updated web interface includes a new search engine for complex
   queries and a fully re-designed entry page for a better overview of
   structural data. It is now possible to compare unit positions, together

Abstract = {{Fanconi anemia complementation groups - I (FANCI) protein facilitates
   DNA ICL (Inter-Cross-link) repair and plays a crucial role in genomic
   integrity. FANCI is a 1328 amino acids protein which contains armadillo
   (ARM) repeats and EDGE motif at the C-terminus. ARM repeats are
   functionally diverse and evolutionarily conserved domain that plays a
   pivotal role in protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions.
   Considering the importance of ARM repeats, we have explored
   comprehensive in silico and in vitro approach to examine folding
   pattern. Size exclusion chromatography, dynamic light scattering (DLS)
   and glutaraldehyde crosslinking studies suggest that FANCI ARM repeat
   exist as monomer as well as in oligomeric forms. Circular dichroism (CD)
   and fluorescence spectroscopy results demonstrate that protein has
   predominantly alpha- helices and well-folded tertiary structure. DNA
   binding was analysed using electrophoretic mobility shift assay by
   autoradiography. Temperature-dependent CD, Fluorescence spectroscopy and
   DLS studies concluded that protein unfolds and start forming oligomer
   from 30 degrees C. The existence of stable portion within FANCI ARM
   repeat was examined using limited proteolysis and mass spectrometry. The
   normal mode analysis, molecular dynamics and principal component
   analysis demonstrated that helix-turn-helix (HTH) motif present in ARM
   repeat is highly dynamic and has anti-correlated motion. Furthermore,
   FANCI ARM repeat has HTH structural motif which binds to double-stranded
   DNA.}},

Abstract = {{The biogenesis and activity of chloroplasts in both vascular plants and
   algae depends on an intracellular network of nucleus-encoded,
   trans-acting factors that control almost all aspects of organellar gene
   expression. Most of these regulatory factors belong to the helical
   repeat protein superfamily, which includes tetratricopeptide repeat,
   pentatricopeptide repeat, and the recently identified octotricopeptide
   repeat (OPR) proteins. Whereas green algae express many different OPR
   proteins, only a single orthologous OPR protein is encoded in the
   genomes of most land plants. Here, we report the characterization of the
   only OPR protein in Arabidopsis thaliana, RAP, which has previously been
   implicated in plant pathogen defense. Loss of RAP led to a severe defect
   in processing of chloroplast 16S rRNA resulting in impaired chloroplast
   translation and photosynthesis. In vitro RNA binding and RNase
   protection assays revealed that RAP has an intrinsic and specific RNA
   binding capacity, and the RAP binding site was mapped to the 5' region
   of the 16S rRNA precursor. Nucleoid localization of RAP was shown by
   transient green fluorescent protein import assays, implicating the
   nucleoid as the site of chloroplast rRNA processing. Taken together, our
   data indicate that the single OPR protein in Arabidopsis is important
   for a basic process of chloroplast biogenesis.}},

Abstract = {{RepeatsDB (http://repeatsdb.bio.unipd.it/) is a database of annotated
   tandem repeat protein structures. Tandem repeats pose a difficult
   problem for the analysis of protein structures, as the underlying
   sequence can be highly degenerate. Several repeat types haven been
   studied over the years, but their annotation was done in a case-by-case
   basis, thus making large-scale analysis difficult. We developed
   RepeatsDB to fill this gap. Using state-of-the-art repeat detection
   methods and manual curation, we systematically annotated the Protein
   Data Bank, predicting 10 745 repeat structures. In all, 2797 structures
   were classified according to a recently proposed classification schema,
   which was expanded to accommodate new findings. In addition, detailed
   annotations were performed in a subset of 321 proteins. These
   annotations feature information on start and end positions for the
   repeat regions and units. RepeatsDB is an ongoing effort to
   systematically classify and annotate structural protein repeats in a
   consistent way. It provides users with the possibility to access and
   download high-quality datasets either interactively or programmatically
   through web services.}},

Abstract = {{Pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins are sequence-specific
   RNA-binding proteins that form a pervasive family of proteins conserved
   in yeast, plants, and humans. The plant PPR proteins are grouped mainly
   into the P and PLS classes. Here, we report the crystal structure of a
   PLS-class PPR protein from Arabidopsis thaliana called THA8L (THA8-like)
   at 2.0 angstrom. THA8L resembles THA8 (thylakoid assembly 8), a protein
   that is required for the splicing of specific group II introns of genes
   involved in biogenesis of chloroplast thylakoid membranes. The THA8L
   structure contains three P-type PPR motifs flanked by one L-type motif
   and one S-type motif. We identified several putative THA8L-binding
   sites, enriched with purine sequences, in the group II introns.
   Importantly, THA8L has strong binding preference for single-stranded RNA
   over single-stranded DNA or double-stranded RNA. Structural analysis
   revealed that THA8L contains two extensive patches of positively charged
   residues next to the residues that are proposed to comprise the
   RNA-binding codes. Mutations in these two positively charged patches
   greatly reduced THA8L RNA-binding activity. On the basis of these data,
   we constructed a model of THA8L-RNA binding that is dependent on two
   forces: one is the interaction between nucleotide bases and specific
   amino acids in the PPR motifs (codes), and the other is the interaction
   between the negatively charged RNA backbone and positively charged
   residues of PPR motifs. Together, these results further our
   understanding of the mechanism of PPR protein-RNA interactions.}},

Abstract = {{Pathogenesis of many bacterially-induced inflammatory diseases is driven
   by Toll-like receptor (TLR) mediated immune responses following
   recognition of bacterial factors by different TLRs. Periodontitis is a
   chronic inflammation of the tooth supporting apparatus often leading to
   tooth loss, and is caused by a Gram-negative bacterial consortium that
   includes Tannerella forsythia. This bacterium expresses a virulence
   factor, the BspA, which drives periodontal inflammation by activating
   TLR2. The N-terminal portion of the BspA protein comprises a
   leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain previously shown to be involved in the
   binding and activation of TLR2. The objective of the current study was
   to identify specific epitopes in the LRR domain of BspA that interact
   with TLR2. Our results demonstrate that a sequence motif GC(S/T)GLXSIT
   is involved in mediating the interaction of BspA with TLR2. Thus, our
   study has identified a peptide motif that mediates the binding of a
   bacterial protein to TLR2 and highlights the promiscuous nature of TLR2
   with respect to ligand binding. This work could provide a structural
   basis for designing peptidomimetics to modulate the activity of TLR2 in
   order to block bacterially-induced inflammation. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{Pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins are members of one of the
   largest nucleus-encoded protein families in plants. Here, we describe
   the previously uncharacterized maize (Zea mays) PPR gene, MPPR6, which
   was isolated from a Mutator-induced collection of maize kernel mutants
   by a cDNA-based forward genetic approach. Identification of a second
   mutant allele and cosegregation analysis confirmed correlation with the
   mutant phenotype. Histological investigations revealed that the mutation
   coincides with abnormities in the transfer cell layer, retardation of
   embryo development, and a considerable reduction of starch level. The
   function of MPPR6 is conserved across a wide phylogenetic distance as
   revealed by heterologous complementation of the Arabidopsis thaliana
   mutant in the orthologous APPR6 gene. MPPR6 appeared to be exclusively
   present in mitochondria. RNA coimmunoprecipitation and in vitro binding
   studies revealed a specific physical interaction of MPPR6 with the 59
   untranslated region of ribosomal protein S3 (rps3) mRNA. Mapping of
   transcript termini showed specifically extended rps3 59 ends in the
   mppr6 mutant. Considerable reduction of mitochondrial translation was
   observed, indicating loss of RPS3 function. This is consistent with the
   appearance of truncated RPS3 protein lacking the N terminus in mppr6.
   Our results suggest that MPPR6 is directly involved in 59 maturation and
   translation initiation of rps3 mRNA.}},

Abstract = {{The expressions of chloroplast and mitochondria genes are tightly
   controlled by numerous nuclear-encoded proteins, mainly at the
   post-transcriptional level. Recent analyses have identified a large,
   plant-specific family of pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) motif-containing
   proteins that are exclusively involved in RNA metabolism of organelle
   genes via sequence-specific RNA binding. A tandem array of PPR motifs
   within the protein is believed to facilitate the RNA interaction,
   although little is known of the mechanism. Here, we describe the RNA
   interacting framework of a PPR protein, Arabidopsis HCF152. First, we
   demonstrated that a Pfam model could be relevant to the PPR motif
   function. A series of proteins with two PPR motifs showed significant
   differences in their RNA binding affinities, indicating functional
   differences among PPR motifs. Mutagenesis and informatics analysis
   putatively identified five amino acids organizing its RNA binding
   surface {[}the 1st, 4th, 8th, 12th and `ii'(-2nd) amino acids] and their
   complex connections. SELEX (Systematic evolution of ligands by
   exponential enrichment) and nucleobase preference assays determined the
   nucleobases with high affinity for HCF152 and suggested several
   characteristic amino acids that may be involved in determining
   specificity and/or affinity of the PPR/RNA interaction.}},

Abstract = {{Precise balance between phosphorylation, catalyzed by protein kinases,
   and dephosphorylation, catalyzed by protein phosphatases, is essential
   for cellular homeostasis. Deregulation of this balance leads to
   pathophysiological states that drive diseases such as cancer, heart
   disease, and diabetes. The recent discovery of the PHLPP (pleckstrin
   homology domain leucinerich repeat protein phosphatase) family of
   Ser/Thr phosphatases adds a new player to the cast of
   phosphate-controlling enzymes in cell signaling. PHLPP isozymes catalyze
   the dephosphorylation of a conserved regulatory motif, the hydrophobic
   motif, on the AGC kinases Akt, PKC, and S6 kinase, as well as an
   inhibitory site on the kinase Mst1, to inhibit cellular proliferation
   and induce apoptosis. The frequent deletion of PHLPP in cancer, coupled
   with the development of prostate tumors in mice lacking PHLPP1,
   identifies PHLPP as a novel tumor suppressor. This minireview discusses
   the structure, function, and regulation of PHLPP, with particular focus
   on its role in disease.}},

Abstract = {{Leucine-rich repeat containing proteins are involved in immune response

   protein with 13 leucine-rich repeats from hemolymph of the insect
   Manduca sexta. After injection of bacteria, leureptin mRNA level
   increased in fat body, but protein levels in plasma decreased, an
   indication that leureptin is consumed during the immune response.
   Leureptin bound to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Microscopy using
   leureptin antiserum showed that leureptin associates with hemocytes
   after injection of bacteria, an indication that leureptin is involved in
   hemocyte responses to bacterial infection. Sequence database searches

Abstract = {{In searching for new targets for antimalarials we investigated the
   biosynthesis of hypusine present in eukaryotic initiation factor-5A
   (eIF-5A) in Plasmodium. Here, we describe the cloning and expression of
   deoxyhypusine hydroxylase (DOHH), which completes the modi. cation of
   eIF-5A through hydroxylation of deoxyhypusine. The dohh cDNA sequence
   revealed an ORF of 1236 bp encoding a protein of 412 amino acids with a
   calculated molecular mass of 46.45 kDa and an isoelectric point of 4.96.
   Interestingly, DOHH from Plasmodium has a FASTA SCORE of only 27
   compared with its human ortholog and contains several matches similar to
   E-Z-type HEAT-like repeat proteins (IPR004155 (InterPro), PF03130
   (Pfam), SM00567 (SMART) present in the phycocyanin lyase subunits of
   cyanobacteria. Purified DOHH protein displayed hydroxylase activity in a
   novel in vitro DOHH assay, but phycocyanin lyase activity was absent.
   dohh is present as a single-copy gene and is transcribed in the asexual
   blood stages of the parasite. A signal peptide at the N-terminus might
   direct the protein to a different cellular compartment. During
   evolution, Plasmodium falciparum acquired an apicoplast that lost its
   photosynthetic function. It is possible that plasmodial DOHH arose from
   an E/F-type phycobilin lyase that gained a new role in hydroxylation.}},

Volume = {{21}},

Abstract = {{RNA editing in flowering plant mitochondria alters 400 to 500
   nucleotides from C to U, changing the information content of most mRNAs
   and some tRNAs. So far, none of the specific or general factors
   responsible for RNA editing in plant mitochondria have been identified.
   Here, we characterize a nuclear-encoded gene that is involved in RNA
   editing of three specific sites in different mitochondrial mRNAs in
   Arabidopsis thaliana, editing sites rps4-956, nad7-963, and nad2-1160.
   The encoded protein MITOCHONDRIAL RNA EDITING FACTOR1 (MEF1) belongs to
   the DYW subfamily of pentatricopeptide repeat proteins. Amino acid
   identities altered in MEF1 from ecotype C24, in comparison to Columbia,
   lower the activity at these editing sites; single amino acid changes in
   mutant plants inactivate RNA editing. These variations most likely
   modify the affinity of the editing factor to the affected editing sites
   in C24 and in the mutant plants. Since lowered and even absent RNA
   editing is tolerated at these sites, the amino acid changes may be
   silent for the respective protein functions. Possibly more than these
   three identified editing sites are addressed by this first factor
   identified for RNA editing in plant mitochondria.}},

Abstract = {{The Notch ankyrin domain is a repeat protein whose folding has been
   characterized through equilibrium and kinetic measurements. In previous
   work, equilibrium folding free energies of truncated constructs were
   used to generate an experimentally determined folding energy landscape
   (Mello and Barrick, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 2004;101:14102-14107). Here,
   this folding energy landscape is used to parameterize a kinetic model in
   which local transition probabilities between partly folded states are
   based on energy values from the landscape. The landscape-based model
   correctly predicts highly diverse experimentally determined folding
   kinetics of the Notch ankyrin domain and sequence variants. These
   predictions include monophasic folding and biphasic unfolding, curvature
   in the unfolding limb of the chevron plot, population of a transient
   unfolding intermediate, relative folding rates of 19 variants spanning
   three orders of magnitude, and a change in the folding pathway that
   results from C-terminal stabilization. These findings indicate that the
   folding pathway(s) of the Notch ankyrin domain are thermodynamically
   selected: the primary determinants of kinetic behavior can be simply
   deduced from the local stability of individual repeats.}},

Abstract = {{In a search of new, small leucine-rich repeat proteoglycan/protein
   (SLRP) family members, a novel gene, nephrocan (NPN), has been
   identified. The gene consists of three exons, and based on the deduced
   amino acid sequence, NPN has 17 leucine-rich repeat motifs and unique
   cysteine-rich clusters both in the N and C termini, indicating that this
   gene belongs to a new class of SLRP family. NPN mRNA was predominantly
   expressed in kidney in adult mice, and during mouse embryogenesis, the
   expression was markedly increased in 11-day-old embryos at a time when
   early kidney development takes place. In the adult mouse kidney, NPN
   protein was located in distal tubules and collecting ducts. When NPN was
   overexpressed in cell culture, the protein was detected in the cultured
   medium, and upon treatment with N-glycosidase F, the molecular mass was
   lowered by similar to 14 kDa, indicating that NPN is a secreted
   N-glycosylated protein. Furthermore, transforming growth
   factor-beta(TGF-beta)-responsive 3TP promoter luciferase activity was
   down-regulated, and TGF-beta-induced Smad3 phosphorylation was also
   inhibited by NPN, suggesting that NPN suppresses TGF-beta/Smad
   signaling. Taken together, NPN is a novel member of the SLRP family that
   may play important roles in kidney development and pathophysiology by
   functioning as an endogenous inhibitor of TGF-beta signaling.}},

Abstract = {{The genome of the diurnal cyanobacterium Cyanothece sp. PCC 51142 has
   recently been sequenced and observed to contain 35 pentapeptide repeat
   proteins (PRPs). These proteins, while present throughout the
   prokaryotic and eukaryotic kingdoms, are most abundant in cyanobacteria.
   The sheer number of PRPs in cyanobacteria coupled with their predicted
   location in every cellular compartment argues for important, yet
   unknown, physiological and biochemical functions. To gain biochemical
   insights, the crystal structure for Rfr32, a 167-residue PRP with an
   N-terminal 29-residue signal peptide, was determined at 2.1 angstrom
   resolution. The structure is dominated by 21 tandem pentapeptide repeats
   that fold into a right-handed quadrilateral beta-helix, or Rfr-fold, as
   observed for the tandem pentapeptide repeats in the only other PRP
   structure, the mycobacterial fluoroquinoline resistance protein MfpA
   from Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Sitting on top of the Rfr-fold are two
   short, antiparallel alpha-helices, bridged with a disulfide bond, that
   perhaps prevent edge-to-edge aggregation at the C terminus. Analysis of
   the main-chain (Phi, Psi) dihedral orientations for the pentapeptide
   repeats in Rfr32 and MfpA makes it possible to recognize the structural
   details for the two distinct types of four-residue turns adopted by the
   pentapeptide repeats in the Rfr-fold. These turns, labeled type II and
   type IV beta-turns, may be universal motifs that shape the Rfr-fold in
   all PRPs.}},

Abstract = {{Genes composed of tandem repetitive sequence motifs are abundant in
   nature and are enriched in eukaryotes. To investigate repeat protein
   gene formation mechanisms, we have conducted a large-scale analysis of
   their introns and exons. We find that a wide variety of repeat motifs
   exhibit a striking conservation of intron position and phase, and are
   composed of exons that encode one or two complete repeats. These results
   suggest a simple model of repeat protein gene formation from local
   duplications. This model is corroborated by amino acid sequence
   similarity patterns among neighboring repeats from various repeat
   protein genes. The distribution of one- and two-repeat exons indicates
   that intron-facilitated repeat motif duplication, in which the start and
   end points of duplication are located in consecutive intronic regions,
   significantly exceeds intron-independent duplication. These results
   suggest that introns have contributed to the greater abundance of repeat
   protein genes in eukaryotic versus prokaryotic organisms, a conclusion
   that is supported by taxonomic analysis. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{In this paper, we report a novel pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) protein
   gene in rice. PPR, a characteristic repeat motif consisted of tandem 35
   amino acids, has been found in various biological systems including
   plant. Sequence analysis revealed that the gene designated OsPPR1
   consisted of an open reading frame of 2433 nucleotides encoding 8 10
   amino acids that include 11 PPR motifs. Blast search result indicated
   that the gene did not align with any of the characterized PPR genes in
   plant. The OsPPR1 gene was found to contain a putative chloroplast
   transit peptide in the N-terminal region, suggesting that the gene
   product targets to the chloroplast. Southern blot hybridization
   indicated that the OsPPR1 is the member of a gene family within the rice
   genome. Expression analysis and immunoblot analysis suggested that the
   OsPPR1 was accumulated mainly in rice leaf. Antisense transgenic
   strategy was used to suppress the expression of OsPPR1 and the resulted
   transgenic rice showed the typical phenotypes of chlorophyll-deficient
   mutants; albinism and lethality. Cytological observation using
   microscopy revealed that the antisense transgenic plant contained a
   significant defect in the chloroplast development. Taken together, the
   results suggest that the OsPPR1 is a nuclear gene of rice, encoding the
   PPR protein that might play a role in the chloroplast biogenesis. This
   is the first report on the PPR protein required for the chloroplast
   biogenesis in rice.}},

Abstract = {{The rice (Oryza sativa) spotted leaf11 (spl11) mutant was identified
   from an ethyl methanesulfonate-mutagenized indica cultivar IR68
   population and was previously shown to display a spontaneous cell death
   phenotype and enhanced resistance to rice fungal and bacterial
   pathogens. Here, we have isolated Spl11 via a map-based cloning
   strategy. The isolation of the Spill gene was facilitated by the
   identification of three additional spill alleles from an IR64 mutant
   collection. The predicted SPL11 protein contains both a U-box domain and
   an armadillo (ARM) repeat domain, which were demonstrated in yeast and
   mammalian systems to be involved in ubiquitination and protein-protein
   interactions, respectively. Amino acid sequence comparison indicated
   that the similarity between SPL11 and other plant U-box-ARM proteins is
   mostly restricted to the U-box and ARM repeat regions. A single base
   substitution was detected in spl11, which results in a premature stop
   codon in the SPL11 protein. Expression analysis indicated that Spl11 is
   induced in both incompatible and compatible riceblast interactions. In
   vitro ubiquitination assay indicated that the SPL11 protein possesses E3
   ubiquitin ligase activity that is dependent on an intact U-box domain,
   suggesting a role of the ubiquitination system in the control of plant
   cell death and defense.}},

Abstract = {{We have identified and characterized a novel single span transmembrane
   leucine-rich repeat protein, synleurin, that renders cells highly
   sensitive to the activation by cytokines and lipopolysaccharide (LPS).
   The major part of the extracellular domain consists of a leucine-rich
   repeats (LRR) cassette. The LRR central core has 12 analogous LRR
   repeating modules arranged in a seamless tandem array. The LRRs are most
   homologous to that of chondroadherin, insulin-like growth factor binding
   proteins, platelet glycoprotein V, slits, and toll-like receptors.
   Synleurin expression was detected at low levels in many tissues,
   including smooth muscle, brain, uterus. pancreas, cartilage, adipose,
   spleen, and testis. When synleurin is ecotopically expressed in
   transfected cells, the cells exhibit amplified responses to bFGF. EGF,
   PDGF-B, IGF-1, IGF-2, and LPS. Synleurin gene (slrn) maps to human
   chromosome at 5q12. The name synleurin reflects its synergistic effect

Abstract = {{Ogura cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) in radish (Raphanus sativus) is
   caused by an aberrant mitochondrial gene, Orf138, that prevents the
   production of functional pollen without affecting female fertility. Rfo,
   a nuclear gene that restores male fertility, alters the expression of
   Orf138 at the post-transcriptional level. The Ogura CMS/Rfo
   two-component system is a useful model for investigating nuclear -
   cytoplasmic interactions, as well as the physiological basis of
   fertility restoration. Using a combination of positional cloning and
   microsynteny analysis of Arabidopsis thaliana and radish, we genetically
   and physically delimited the Rfo locus to a 15-kb DNA segment. Analysis
   of this segment shows that Rfo is a member of the pentatricopeptide
   repeat (PPR) family. In Arabidopsis, this family contains more than 450
   members of unknown function, although most of them are predicted to be
   targeted to mitochondria and chloroplasts and are thought to have roles

Abstract = {{We have recently described a large (20 S) protein arginine
   methyltransferase complex, termed the methylosome, that contains the
   methyltransferase JBP1 (PRMT5) and the pICln protein. The methylosome
   functions to modify specific arginines to dimethylarginines in the
   arginine- and glycine-rich domains of several spliceosomal Sm proteins,
   and this modification targets these proteins to the survival of motor
   neurons (SMN) complex for assembly into small nuclear ribonucleoprotein
   (snRNP) core particles. Here, we describe a novel component of the
   methylosome, a 50-kilodalton WD repeat protein termed methylosome
   protein 50 (MEP50). We show that MEP50 is important for methylosome
   activity and binds to JBP1 and to a subset of Sm proteins. Because WD
   repeat proteins provide a platform for multiple protein interactions,
   MEP50 may function to mediate the interaction of multiple substrates
   with the methylosome. Interestingly, all of the known components of the
   methylosome bind Sm proteins, suggesting that in addition to producing
   properly methylated substrates for the SMN complex, the methylosome may
   be involved in Sm protein rearrangements or pre-assembly required for
   snRNP biogenesis.}},

Abstract = {{Merozoite surface protein 3 (MSP3), an important vaccine candidate, is a
   soluble polymorphic antigen associated with the surface of Plasmodium
   falciparum merozoites. The MSP3 sequence contains three blocks of heptad
   repeats that are consistent with the formation of an intramolecular
   coiled-coil. MSP3 also contains a glutamic acid-rich region and a
   putative leucine zipper sequence at the C-terminus. We have disrupted
   the msp3 gene by homologous recombination, resulting in the expression
   of a truncated form of MSP3 that lacks the putative leucine zipper
   sequence but retains the glutamic acid-rich region and the heptad
   repeats. Here, we show that truncated MSP3, lacking the putative leucine
   zipper region, does not localize to the parasitophorous vacuole or
   interact with the merozoite surface. Furthermore, the acidic-basic
   repeat antigen (ABRA), which is present on the merozoite surface, also
   was not localized to the merozolte surface in parasites expressing the
   truncated form of MSP3. The P falciparum merozoites lacking MSP3 and
   ABRA on the surface show reduced invasion into erythrocytes. These
   results suggest that MSP3 is not absolutely essential for blood stage
   growth and that the putative leucine zipper region is required for the
   trafficking of both MSP3 and ABRA to the parasitophorous vacuole.}},

Abstract = {{Densin-180, a protein purified from the postsynaptic density fraction of
   the rat forebrain, is the founding member of a newly described family of
   proteins termed the LAP (leucine-rich repeats and PSD-95/Dlg-A/ZO-1
   (PDZ) domains) family that plays essential roles in establishment of
   cell polarity. To identify Densin-180-binding proteins, we screened a
   yeast two-hybrid library using the carboxyl-terminal fragment of
   Densin-180 containing PDZ domain as bait, and we isolated
   delta-catenin/neural plakophilin-related armadillo repeat protein
   (NPRAP) as a Densin-180-interacting protein. delta-catenin/NPRAP, a
   member of the armadillo repeat family, is a nervous system-specific
   adherens junction protein originally discovered as an interactor with
   presenilin-1, a protein involved in Alzheimer's disease. Densin-180 PDZ
   domain binds the COOH terminus of delta-catenin/NPRAP containing the PDZ
   domain-binding sequence. Endogenous Densin-180 was co-immunoprecipitated
   with delta-catenin/NPRAP and N-cadherin. Although Densin-180 was
   reported to be a transmembrane protein, Densin-180 was not accessible to
   surface biotinylation in dissociated hippocampal neurons; hence
   Densin-180 may be a cytosolic protein. Densin-180 colocalized with
   delta-catenin/NPRAP at synapses in dissociated hippocampal neurons. We
   propose that Densin-180 is associated in vivo with delta-catenin/NPRAP
   and may be involved in organization of the synaptic cell-cell junction
   through interaction with the delta-catenin/NPRAP-N-cadherin complex.}},

Abstract = {{We cloned a novel ankyrin repeat protein, Arpp, by immunoscreening a
   cDNA library constructed from a human esophageal carcinoma cell line,
   TE1, with an antibody directed to a hypothetical protein encoded by
   antisense p53 mRNA. Arpp protein is composed of 333 amino acids and
   contains four ankyrin-like repeat motifs in the middle portion of the
   protein, a PEST-like sequence and a lysine-rich sequence similar to a
   nuclear localization signal in the N-terminal region, and a proline-rich
   region containing consensus phosphorylation sites in the C-terminal
   region. Protein sequence analysis revealed that Arpp is homologous
   (52.7\% identity) to Carp which is shown to be involved in the
   regulation of the transcription of the cardiac ventricular myosin light
   chain 2 gene. Arpp mRNA was found to be expressed in normal skeletal and
   cardiac muscle. Interestingly, Arpp expression was detectable in
   bilateral ventricles, but undetectable in bilateral atria and large
   vessels, suggesting that Arpp may play a specific function in cardiac
   ventricles as well as skeletal muscles. (C) 2001 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{Asporin, a novel member of the leucine-rich repeat family of proteins,
   was partially purified from human articular cartilage and meniscus.
   Cloning of human and mouse asporin cDNAs revealed that the protein is
   closely related to decorin and biglycan. It contains a putative
   propeptide, 4 amino-terminal cysteines, 10 leucine-rich repeats, and 2
   C-terminal cysteines. In contrast to decorin and biglycan, asporin is
   not a proteoglycan. Instead, asporin contains a unique stretch of
   aspartic acid residues in its amino-terminal region. A polymorphism was
   identified in that the number of consecutive aspartate residues varied
   from 11 to 15. The 8 exons of the human asporin gene span 26 kilobases
   on chromosome 9q31.1-32, and the putative promoter region lacks TATA
   consensus sequences. The asporin mRNA is expressed in a variety of human
   tissues with higher levels in osteoarthritic articular cartilage, aorta,
   uterus, heart, and liver. The deduced amino acid sequence of asporin was
   confirmed by mass spectrometry of the isolated protein resulting in 84\%
   sequence coverage. The protein contains an N-glycosylation site at
   Asn(281) with a heterogeneous oligosaccharide structure and a potential
   O-glycosylation site at Ser(54). The name asporin reflects the
   aspartate-rich amino terminus and the overall similarity to decorin.}},

Year = {{2001}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{2}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Synechocystis PCC6803 possesses several open reading frames encoding
   putative WD-repeat proteins. One, the Hat protein, is involved in the
   control of a high-affinity transport system for inorganic carbon that is
   active when the cells are grown under a limiting concentration of this
   carbon substrate. The protein is composed of two major domains separated
   by a hydrophobic linker region of 20 amino acid residues. The N-terminal
   domain of Hat has no homolog in standard databases and does not display
   any particular structural features. Eleven WD repeats have been
   identified in the C-terminal moiety. The region encompassing the four
   terminal WD repeats is essential for growth under a limiting inorganic
   carbon regime. The region encompassing the two most terminal WD repeats
   is required for the activity of the high-affinity transport system.
   However, because the Hat protein is located in the thylakoids, it should
   not be itself an element of the transport system. The structural
   organization of the WD-containing domain of Hat was modeled from the
   crystal structure of the G protein P subunit (with seven WD repeats) and
   of hemopexin (a structural analog with four blades). Functional and
   structural data argue in favor of an organization of the Hat WD moiety
   in two subdomains of seven and four WD repeats. The C-terminal 4-mer
   subdomain might interact with another, yet unknown, protein/peptide.
   This interaction could be essential in modulating the stability of the
   4-mer structure and, thus, the accessibility of this subdomain, or at
   least of the region encompassing the last two WD repeats.}},

   the genomic structure, gene products, and the expression profiles. The
   human WDC146 gene had 22 exons spanning over 105 kb, and these exons
   were distributed in three islands intervened by two long introns of
   around 40 kb. A minimum promoter region was identified within a 0.5 kb
   5'-upstream region of exon 1. WDC146 mRNA was most highly expressed in
   human testis on Northern blot analysis. In mouse tissues, the highest
   expression was also observed in testis. By in situ hybridization on rat
   tissues, WDC146 mRNA was detected preferentially in the pachytene stage
   of spermatocytes in testis, and weakly in white pulp/marginal band of
   spleen and in cortex of thymus. WDC146 protein was found to be localized

Abstract = {{Members of the armadillo (arm) repeat family of proteins are implicated
   in tumorigenesis, embryonic development, and maintenance of tissue
   integrity. We have cloned cDNA for a novel human arm repeat protein,
   ALEX1, encoding 453 amino acids. ALEX1 shares significant homology with
   uncharacterized ORF KIAA0512 and putative protein product of unknown
   mRNA (GenBank AF211175), designated here as ALEX2 and ALEX3,
   respectively. The genes encoding ALEX1, ALEX2 and ALEX3 co-localize to
   the same region in Xq21.33-q22.2. ALEX1 and ALEX2 transcripts are found
   in all human tissues examined except peripheral blood leukocytes.
   Expression of ALEX1 and ALEX2 mRNA is lost or significantly reduced in
   human lung, prostate, colon, pancreas, and ovarian carcinomas and also
   in cell lines established from different human carcinomas. These genes
   are, however, normally expressed in cell lines derived from other types
   of tumors, e.g., sarcomas, neuroblastomas, and gliomas. We speculate
   that ALEX genes may play a role in suppression of tumors originating hom
   epithelial tissue,i.e., carcinomas. (C) 2001 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{The ankyrin repeat is an abundant, 33 residue sequence motif that forms
   a consecutive beta-hairpin-helix-loop-helix (beta(2)alpha(2)) fold. Most
   ankyrin repeat proteins consist of four or more complete repeats, which
   provide stabilizing interactions between adjacent modules. The
   cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor and tumor suppressor p16(INK4) (p16)
   is one of the smallest ankyrin repeat proteins with a known structure.
   It consists of four complete repeats plus short N and C-terminal
   flanking regions that are unstructured in solution. On the basis of
   preliminary proteolysis studies and predictions using a computer
   algorithm for identifying autonomous folding units, we have identified a
   fragment consisting of the third and fourth ankyrin repeats of p16,
   called p16C, that can fold independently, without the rest of the
   protein. Far-UV circular dichroism studies showed that p16C has a
   significant level of alpha-helical secondary structure, and two proline
   substitutions that disrupt the alpha-helical secondary structure in
   wild-type p16 disrupt the secondary structure in p16C. The thermal
   denaturation of p16C is cooperative and reversible, with a midpoint of
   transition at 30.5(+/-)degrees C. From urea-induced denaturation
   studies, the free energy of unfolding for p16C was estimated to be
   1.7(+/-0.3)kcal/mol at 20 degrees C. H-1-N-15 2D NMR studies suggest
   that the ankyrin repeats in p16C are likely to fold into a structure
   similar to that of full-length p16. In order to define the minimum
   autonomous folding unit in p16, we have further dissected p16C into two
   complementary peptides, each containing a single ankyrin repeat. These
   peptides are unstructured in solution. Thus, p16C is the smallest
   ankyrin repeat module that is known to fold independently and, in
   general, we believe that the two-ankyrin repeat fold could be the
   minimum structural unit for all ankyrin repeat proteins. We further
   discuss the significance of p16C in protein folding and engineering. (C)

Abstract = {{The sequential binding of different tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR)
   proteins to heat shock protein 90 (hsp90) is essential to its chaperone
   function in vivo. We have previously shown that three basic residues in
   the TPR domain of PP5 are required for binding to the acidic C-terminal
   domain of hsp90. We have now tested which acidic residues in this
   C-terminal domain are required for binding to three different TPR
   proteins as follows: PP5, FKBP52, and Hop. Mutation of Glu-729, Glu-730,
   and Asp-732 at the C terminus of hsp90 interfered with binding of all
   three TPR proteins. Mutation of Glu-720, Asp-722, Asp-723, and Asp-724
   inhibited binding of FKBP52 and PP5 but not of Hop. Mutation of Glu-651
   and Asp-653 did not affect binding of FKBP52 or PP5 but inhibited both
   Hop binding and hsp90 chaperone activity. We also found that a conserved
   Lys residue required for PP5 binding to hsp90 was critical for the
   binding of FKBP52 but not for the binding of Hop to hsp90. These results
   suggest distinct but overlapping binding sites on hsp90 for different
   TPR proteins and indicate that the binding site for Hop, which is
   associated with hsp90 in intermediate stages of protein folding,
   overlaps with a site of chaperone activity.}},

Abstract = {{The zebrafish, Danio rerio, has three types of pigment cells
   (melanophores, xanthophores and iridophores) and, in adult fish, these
   cells are organized into a stripe pattern. The mechanisms underlying
   formation of the stripe pattern are largely unknown. We report here the
   identification and characterization of a novel dominant zebrafish
   mutation, hagoromo (hag), which was generated by insertional mutagenesis
   using a pseudotyped tetrovirus. The hag mutation caused disorganized
   stripe patterns. Two hag mutant alleles were isolated independently and
   proviruses were located within the fifth intron of a novel gene, which
   we named hag, encoding an F-box/WD40-repeat protein. The hag gene was
   mapped to linkage group (LG)13, close to fgf8 and pax2.1. Amino acid
   sequence similarity, conserved exon-intron boundaries and conserved
   synteny indicated that zebrafish hag is an ortholog of mouse Dactylin,
   the gene mutated in the Dactylaplasia (Dac) mouse {[}1]. The Dac
   mutation is dominant and causes defects in digit formation in fore- and
   hindlimbs. This study revealed that the hag locus is important for
   pattern formation in fish but is involved in distinct morphogenetic
   events in different vertebrates.}},

Abstract = {{The LC1 light chain from Chlamydomonas outer arm dynein is tightly bound

   member of the SDS22+ subclass of the leucine-rich repeat protein family

   and the components of a signal transduction pathway. Through the
   combination of covalent cross-linking and vanadate-mediated photolysis,
   LC1 was found to associate with that portion of the gamma HC that is
   C-terminal to the P1 loop. This region comprises most of the globular
   head domain of the heavy chain and includes the stalk-like structure
   that is involved in microtubule binding. Attachment of LC1 to this
   region represents the only known example of an accessory polypeptide
   directly associated with a dynein motor domain. Additional cross-linking
   experiments revealed that LC1 also interacts directly in situ with an
   similar to 45 kDa axonemal component; this interaction is disrupted by
   the standard high salt treatment used to remove the outer arm from the
   axoneme. These data suggest that LC1 acts to mediate the association
   between this 45 kDa axonemal polypeptide and the motor unit of the gamma

Abstract = {{Rat striatin, a quantitatively minor protein belonging to the WD-repeat
   family of proteins, is a Ca2+/calmodulin-binding protein mostly
   expressed in the striatum and in the motor and olfactory systems
   (Castets, F., Bartoli, M., Barnier, J. V., Baillat, G., Salin, P.,
   Moqrich, A., Bourgeois, J. P., Denizot, F., Rougon, G., Calothy, G., and
   Monneron, A. (1996) J. Cell Biol. 134, 1051-1062). Generally associated
   with membranes, striatin is mostly found in dendritic spines where it is
   likely to play a role in Ca2+-signaling events. In this paper, we
   characterize its calmodulin-binding properties. By using deletion
   mapping and site-directed mutagenesis, we identified the sequence
   located between amino acids 149 and 166 as the main calmodulin-binding
   site. The predicted corresponding peptide is potentially able to form a
   basic amphiphilic helix, as is often the case for many known
   calmodulin-binding sites. Calmodulin binding to striatin is
   Ca2+-dependent, with half-maximal binding occurring around 0.5 mu M free
   Ca2+. In the presence of Ca2+, the equilibrium dissociation constant of
   calmodulin/striatin fusion protein complex is 40 +/- 5 nM. me also show
   that brain striatin subcellular localization, as studied by tissue
   fractionation, is Ca2+-dependent, this effect being probably mediated by
   calmodulin. Our results are in agreement with the hypothesis that
   striatin is a transducer involved in Ca2+ signaling or an adapter
   protein involved in regulating macromolecular assemblies within

Abstract = {{A pMAL(c)-based plasmid clone with a synthetic tac promoter was
   constructed to efficiently express the full-length terminal repeat
   protein 1 (TP1) of Epstein-Barr virus in Escherichia coli. The
   N-terminal part of the recombinant protein is represented by a
   maltose-binding protein, permitting thereby its isolation from bacterial
   lysates by affinity chromatography. Subsequent treatment with
   proteolytic factor Xa yields the target protein in discrete form. A
   tryptophan-regulated vector pATH-11 was used to construct several
   plasmid clones capable of expressing various N- and C-proximal fragments
   of TP1. This collection can be used to obtain corresponding antisera and
   for preliminary immunological mapping of the TP1 molecule.}},

Abstract = {{The cactus protein is the Drosophila homologue of the mammalian I kappa
   B family of cytoplasmic anchor proteins. We have expressed in E. coli
   and purified a cactus fusion protein, CACT-Bgl. CACT-Bgl protein
   contains the six ankyrin repeat sequences which are necessary for
   specific binding to the Drosophila rel family transcription factor
   dorsal. We show that the purified CACT-Bgl protein can bind specifically
   to dorsal and, using circular dichroism spectroscopy, that the protein
   adopts a largely alpha-helical secondary structure. A further analysis
   of the ankyrin repeat domains of cactus, using an improved secondary
   structure prediction program indicates that the N-terminal of the repeat
   will form into a loop structure and the C-terminal section into an
   interrupted, amphipathic a-helix. On the basis of these findings we
   propose that the ankyrin repeats of cactus fold together into helical
   bundles interconnected by diverged loops.}},

Abstract = {{We report the identification of a previously unknown gene, inlA, which
   is necessary for the gram-positive intracellular pathogen Listeria
   monocytogenes to invade cultured epithelial cells. The inlA region was
   localized by transposon mutagenesis, cloned, and sequenced. inlA was
   introduced into Listeria innocua and shown to confer on this normally
   noninvasive species the ability to enter cells. Sequencing of inlA
   predicts an 80 kd protein, internalin. Two-thirds of internalin is made
   up of two regions of repeats, region A and region B, and the C-terminus
   of the molecule is similar to that of surface proteins from
   gram-positive cocci. Internalin has a high content of threonine and
   serine residues, and the repeat motif of region A has regularly spaced
   leucine residues. As evidenced by Southern blot analysis, inlA is part
   of a gene family. One of them is the gene situated directly downstream
   of inlA, called inlB, which also encodes a leucine-rich repeat protein.}},
