abstract={Perception of pathogenic effectors in plants often relies on nucleotide-binding domain (NBS) and leucine-rich-repeat-containing (NLR) proteins. Some NLRs contain additional domains that function as integrated decoys for pathogen effector targets and activation of immune signalling. Wheat stripe rust is one of the most devastating diseases of crop plants. Here, we report the cloning of YrU1, a stripe rust resistance gene from the diploid wheat Triticum urartu, the progenitor of the A genome of hexaploid wheat. YrU1 encodes a coiled-coil-NBS-leucine-rich repeat protein with N-terminal ankyrin-repeat and C-terminal WRKY domains, representing a unique NLR structure in plants. Database searches identify similar architecture only in wheat relatives. Transient expression of YrU1 in Nicotiana benthamiana does not induce cell death in the absence of pathogens. The ankyrin-repeat and coiled-coil domains of YrU1 self-associate, suggesting that homodimerisation is critical for YrU1 function. The identification and cloning of this disease resistance gene sheds light on NLR protein function and may facilitate breeding to control the devastating wheat stripe rust disease. © 2020, The Author(s).},

abstract={In the green alga Chlamydomonas (Chlamydomonas reinhardtii), chloroplast gene expression is tightly regulated posttranscriptionally by gene-specific trans-acting protein factors. Here, we report the identification of the octotricopeptide repeat protein MTHI1, which is critical for the biogenesis of chloroplast ATP synthase oligomycin-sensitive chloroplast coupling factor. Unlike most trans-acting factors characterized so far in Chlamydomonas, which control the expression of a single gene, MTHI1 targets two distinct transcripts: it is required for the accumulation and translation of atpH mRNA, encoding a subunit of the selective proton channel, but it also enhances the translation of atpI mRNA, which encodes the other subunit of the channel. MTHI1 targets the 5' untranslated regions of both the atpH and atpI genes. Coimmunoprecipitation and small RNA sequencing revealed that MTHI1 binds specifically a sequence highly conserved among Chlorophyceae and the Ulvale clade of Ulvophyceae at the 5' end of triphosphorylated atpH mRNA. A very similar sequence, located ∼60 nucleotides upstream of the atpI initiation codon, was also found in some Chlorophyceae and Ulvale algae species and is essential for atpI mRNA translation in Chlamydomonas. Such a dual-targeted trans-acting factor provides a means to coregulate the expression of the two proton hemi-channels. © 2020 American Society of Plant Biologists. All rights reserved.},

abstract={High-throughput construction of multivalent binders and subsequent screening for biological activity represent a fundamental challenge: A linear increase of monovalent components translates to the square of possible bivalent combinations. Even high-efficiency cloning and expression methods become limiting when thousands of bispecific binders need to be screened for activity. In this study, we present an in vitro method for the efficient production of flexibly linked bispecific binding agents from individually expressed and purified monovalent binders. We established a sortase A-mediated coupling reaction to generate bispecific designed ankyrin repeat proteins (DARPins), with an optimized reaction maximizing the bivalent coupling product with low levels of monovalent side-products. These one-pot reaction mixtures could be used directly, without further purification, in cell-based assays. We generated a matrix of 441 different bispecific DARPins against the extracellular domains of the cancer-associated receptors EGFR, ErbB2, ErbB3, ErbB4, EpCAM, and c-MET and screened on two different ErbB2-positive cancer cells lines for growth-inhibitory effects. We identified not only known but also novel biologically active biparatopic DARPins. Furthermore, we found that the cancer cell lines respond in a highly reproducible and defined manner to the treatment with the 441 different bivalent binding agents. The generated response profiles can thus be used for functional characterization of cell lines because they are strongly related to the cell line-specific surface receptor landscape. Thus, our method not only represents a robust tool for screening and lead identification of bispecific binding agents, but additionally offers an orthogonal approach for the functional characterization of cancer cell lines. ©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.},

abstract={Plant microRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding RNAs, which are composed of 20–24 nucleotides. MiRNAs play important roles in plant growth and responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. Wounding is one of the most serious stresses for plants; however, the regulation of miRNAs in plants upon wounding is not well studied. In this study, miR2111, a wound-repressed miRNA, identified previously in sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas cv Tainung 57) by small RNA deep sequencing was chosen for further analysis. Based on sweet potato transcriptome database, F-box/kelch repeat protein (IbFBK), a target gene of miR2111, was identified. IbFBK is a wound-inducible gene, and the miR2111-induced cleavage site in IbFBK mRNA is between the 10th and 11th nucleotides of miR2111. IbFBK is a component of the E3 ligase SCF (SKP1-Cullin-F-box) complex participating in protein ubiquitination and degradation. The results of yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays demonstrate that IbFBK was conjugated with IbSKP1 through the F-box domain in IbFBK N-terminus to form SCF complex, and interacted with IbCNR8 through the kelch-repeat domain in IbFBK C-terminus. The interaction of IbFBK and IbCNR8 may lead to the ubiquitination and degradation of IbCNR8. In conclusion, the suppression of miR2111 resulted in the increase of IbFBK, and may regulate protein degradation of IbCNR8 in sweet potato responding to wounding. © 2019},

abstract={Internal structure similarity in proteins can be observed at the domain and subdomain levels. From an evolutionary perspective, structurally similar elements may arise divergently by gene duplication and fusion events but may also be the product of convergent evolution under physicochemical constraints. The characterization of proteins that contain repeated structural elements has implications for many fields of protein science including protein domain evolution, structure classification, structure prediction, and protein engineering. FiRES (Find Repeated Elements in Structure) is an algorithm that relies on a topology-independent structure alignment method to identify repeating elements in protein structure. FiRES was tested against two hand curated databases of protein repeats: MALIDUP, for very divergent duplicated domains; and RepeatsDB for short tandem repeats. The performance of FiRES was compared to that of lalign, RADAR, HHrepID, CE-symm, ReUPred, and Swelfe. FiRES was the method that most accurately detected proteins either with duplicated domains (accuracy = 0.86) or with multiple repeated units (accuracy = 0.92). FiRES is a new methodology for the discovery of proteins containing structurally similar elements. The FiRES web server is publicly available at http://fires.ifc.unam.mx.

abstract={C-to-U RNA editing has been widely observed in mitochondrial and plastid RNAs in plants. The editing sites are known to be recognized by pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins, which belong to one of the largest protein families in vascular plants. PPR proteins are sequence-specific RNA-binding proteins that participate in various steps of organelle RNA metabolism, such as cleavage, stabilization, splicing, translation, and editing. Elucidating the underlying mechanisms of sequence-specific RNA recognition by PPR proteins expanded our understanding of the role of PPR proteins in plant organellar RNA editing and enabled the computational prediction of target RNA-editing sites for PPR proteins of interest. Combining computational prediction and experimental verification, we identified three new PPR proteins involved in mitochondrial RNA editing: At1g56570, known as PGN for RNA editing of nad6_leader_-73 and cox2_742, At4g04370 for RNA editing of nad5_242, and At2g41080 for atp1_1292. Therefore, At4g04370 and At2g41080 were designated as mitochondrial RNA-editing factor 1 (MREF1) and MREF2, respectively. This study supports the use of computational prediction in establishing connections between PPR proteins and specific RNA-editing sites, which are important for maintaining various physiological processes, such as plant development, embryogenesis, and biotic-and abiotic-stress responses. © 2020 The Japanese Society for Plant Cell and Molecular Biology.},

abstract={Epigenetic dysregulations are closely associated with the development of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), which is one of the most aggressive malignancies and currently has limited treatment options. Vitamin C (VC), an epigenetic mediator, exerts antitumor effects on several types of cancer. However, the clinical application of VC is limited, particularly in PDAC. Thus, to investigate the antitumor effects and explore the potential clinical application of VC in PDAC, the survival of patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas database were analyzed, and proliferation, apoptosis and migration assays were performed in the present study. It was first established that high expression levels of the sodium-dependent VC transporter 2, a critical VC transporter, predicted a good prognosis in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma. It was further confirmed that VC directly inhibited proliferation, induced apoptosis and suppressed migration of human pancreatic cancer cells. Global 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) content was significantly upregulated in pancreatic cancer cells following VC treatment, predominantly relying on ten-eleven translocation 2. Furthermore, VC could specifically increase 5hmC levels at the promotor region on PH domain leucine-rich repeat protein phosphatase 2 (PHLPP2) and enhance PHLPP2 expression levels. When PHLPP2 expression levels were knocked down, VC was able to partially overcome the inhibition of pancreatic cancer cells. These results illustrated a novel and precise mechanism of action of epigenetic alterations that underly the inhibition of VC in pancreatic cancer, and emphasized that PHLPP2 may be a new biomarker and epigenetic target for the clinical treatment of VC in PDAC. © 2020 Spandidos Publications.

abstract={The identification of new factors that may function as cancer markers and become eventual pharmacologic targets is a challenge that may influence the management of tumor development and management. Recent discoveries connecting Hsp90-binding immunophilins with the regulation of signalling events that can modulate cancer progression transform this family of proteins in potential unconventional factors that may impact on the screening and diagnosis of malignant diseases. Immunophilins are molecular chaperones that group a family of intracellular receptors for immunosuppressive compounds. A subfamily of the immunophilin family is characterized by showing structural tetratricopeptide repeats, protein domains that are able to interact with the C-terminal end of the molecular chaperone Hsp90, and via the proper Hsp90-immunophilin complex, the biological properties of a number of client-proteins involved in cancer biology are modulated. Recent discoveries have demonstrated that two of the most studied members of this Hsp90-binding subfamily of immunophilins, FKBP51 and FKBP52, participate in several cellular processes such as apoptosis, carcinogenesis progression, and chemoresistance. While the expression levels of some members of the immunophilin family are affected in both cancer cell lines and human cancer tissues compared to normal samples, novel regulatory mechanisms have emerged during the last few years for several client-factors of immunophilins that are major players in cancer development and progression, among them steroid receptors, the transctiption factor NF-κB and the catalytic subunit of telomerase, hTERT. In this review, recent findings related to the biological properties of both iconic Hsp90-binding immunophilins, FKBP51 and FKBP52, are reviewed within the context of their interactions with those chaperoned client-factors. The potential roles of both immunophilins as potential cancer biomarkers and non-conventional pharmacologic targets for cancer treatment are discussed. © 2020 Bentham Science Publishers.},

abstract={Background: Flavonoids are produced in all flowering plants in a wide range of tissues including in berry fruits. These compounds are of considerable interest for their biological activities, health benefits and potential pharmacological applications. However, transcriptomic and genomic resources for wild and cultivated berry fruit species are often limited, despite their value in underpinning the in-depth study of metabolic pathways, fruit ripening as well as in the identification of genotypes rich in bioactive compounds. Results: To access the genetic diversity of wild and cultivated berry fruit species that accumulate high levels of phenolic compounds in their fleshy berry(-like) fruits, we selected 13 species from Europe, South America and Asia representing eight genera, seven families and seven orders within three clades of the kingdom Plantae. RNA from either ripe fruits (ten species) or three ripening stages (two species) as well as leaf RNA (one species) were used to construct, assemble and analyse de novo transcriptomes. The transcriptome sequences are deposited in the BacHBerryGEN database (http://jicbio.nbi.ac.uk/berries) and were used, as a proof of concept, via its BLAST portal (http://jicbio.nbi.ac.uk/berries/blast.html) to identify candidate genes involved in the biosynthesis of phenylpropanoid compounds. Genes encoding regulatory proteins of the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway (MYB and basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors and WD40 repeat proteins) were isolated using the transcriptomic resources of wild blackberry (Rubus genevieri) and cultivated red raspberry (Rubus idaeus cv. Prestige) and were shown to activate anthocyanin synthesis in Nicotiana benthamiana. Expression patterns of candidate flavonoid gene transcripts were also studied across three fruit developmental stages via the BacHBerryEXP gene expression browser (http://www.bachberryexp.com) in R. genevieri and R. idaeus cv. Prestige. Conclusions: We report a transcriptome resource that includes data for a wide range of berry(-like) fruit species that has been developed for gene identification and functional analysis to assist in berry fruit improvement. These resources will enable investigations of metabolic processes in berries beyond the phenylpropanoid biosynthetic pathway analysed in this study. The RNA-seq data will be useful for studies of berry fruit development and to select wild plant species useful for plant breeding purposes. © 2019 The Author(s).},

abstract={Background: Reverse vaccinology accelerates the discovery of potential vaccine candidates (PVCs) prior to experimental validation. Current programs typically use one bacterial proteome to identify PVCs through a filtering architecture using feature prediction programs or a machine learning approach. Filtering approaches may eliminate potential antigens based on limitations in the accuracy of prediction tools used. Machine learning approaches are heavily dependent on the selection of training datasets with experimentally validated antigens (positive control) and non-protective-antigens (negative control). The use of one or few bacterial proteomes does not assess PVC conservation among strains, an important feature of vaccine antigens. Results: We present ReVac, which implements both a panoply of feature prediction programs without filtering out proteins, and scoring of candidates based on predictions made on curated positive and negative control PVCs datasets. ReVac surveys several genomes assessing protein conservation, as well as DNA and protein repeats, which may result in variable expression of PVCs. ReVac's orthologous clustering of conserved genes, identifies core and dispensable genome components. This is useful for determining the degree of conservation of PVCs among the population of isolates for a given pathogen. Potential vaccine candidates are then prioritized based on conservation and overall feature-based scoring. We present the application of ReVac, applied to 69 Moraxella catarrhalis and 270 non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae genomes, prioritizing 64 and 29 proteins as PVCs, respectively. Conclusion: ReVac's use of a scoring scheme ranks PVCs for subsequent experimental testing. It employs a redundancy-based approach in its predictions of features using several prediction tools. The protein's features are collated, and each protein is ranked based on the scoring scheme. Multi-genome analyses performed in ReVac allow for a comprehensive overview of PVCs from a pan-genome perspective, as an essential pre-requisite for any bacterial subunit vaccine design. ReVac prioritized PVCs of two human respiratory pathogens, identifying both novel and previously validated PVCs. © 2019 The Author(s).},

abstract={MOTIVATION: Thanks to the recent advances in structural biology, nowadays 3D structures of various proteins are solved on a routine basis. A large portion of these structures contain structural repetitions or internal symmetries. To understand the evolution mechanisms of these proteins and how structural repetitions affect the protein function, we need to be able to detect such proteins very robustly. As deep learning is particularly suited to deal with spatially organized data, we applied it to the detection of proteins with structural repetitions. RESULTS: We present DeepSymmetry, a versatile method based on 3D convolutional networks that detects structural repetitions in proteins and their density maps. Our method is designed to identify tandem repeat proteins, proteins with internal symmetries, symmetries in the raw density maps, their symmetry order and also the corresponding symmetry axes. Detection of symmetry axes is based on learning 6D Veronese mappings of 3D vectors, and the median angular error of axis determination is less than one degree. We demonstrate the capabilities of our method on benchmarks with tandem-repeated proteins and also with symmetrical assemblies. For example, we have discovered about 7800 putative tandem repeat proteins in the PDB. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The method is available at https://team.inria.fr/nano-d/software/deepsymmetry. It consists of a C++ executable that transforms molecular structures into volumetric density maps, and a Python code based on the TensorFlow framework for applying the DeepSymmetry model to these maps.

abstract={Background: Fusarium head blight (FHB) resistance in the durum wheat breeding gene pool is rarely reported. Triticum turgidum ssp. carthlicum line Blackbird is a tetraploid relative of durum wheat that offers partial FHB resistance. Resistance QTL were identified for the durum wheat cv. Strongfield × Blackbird population on chromosomes 1A, 2A, 2B, 3A, 6A, 6B and 7B in a previous study. The objective of this study was to identify the defense mechanisms underlying the resistance of Blackbird and report candidate regulator defense genes and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers within these genes for high-resolution mapping of resistance QTL reported for the durum wheat cv. Strongfield/Blackbird population. Results: Gene network analysis identified five networks significantly (P < 0.05) associated with the resistance to FHB spread (Type II FHB resistance) one of which showed significant correlation with both plant height and relative maturity traits. Two gene networks showed subtle differences between Fusarium graminearum-inoculated and mock-inoculated plants, supporting their involvement in constitutive defense. The candidate regulator genes have been implicated in various layers of plant defense including pathogen recognition (mainly Nucleotide-binding Leucine-rich Repeat proteins), signaling pathways including the abscisic acid and mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinase, and downstream defense genes activation including transcription factors (mostly with dual roles in defense and development), and cell death regulator and cell wall reinforcement genes. The expression of five candidate genes measured by quantitative real-time PCR was correlated with that of RNA-seq, corroborating the technical and analytical accuracy of RNA-sequencing. Conclusions: Gene network analysis allowed identification of candidate regulator genes and genes associated with constitutive resistance, those that will not be detected using traditional differential expression analysis. This study also shed light on the association of developmental traits with FHB resistance and partially explained the co-localization of FHB resistance with plant height and maturity QTL reported in several previous studies. It also allowed the identification of candidate hub genes within the interval of three previously reported FHB resistance QTL for the Strongfield/Blackbird population and associated SNPs for future high resolution mapping studies. © 2019 Crown.},

abstract={WD40 repeat-containing proteins (WD40 proteins) serve as versatile scaffolds for protein–protein interactions, modulating a variety of cellular processes such as plant stress and hormone responses. Here we report the identification of a WD40 protein, XIW1 (for XPO1-interacting WD40 protein 1), which positively regulates the abscisic acid (ABA) response in Arabidopsis. XIW1 is located in the cytoplasm and nucleus. We found that it interacts with the nuclear transport receptor XPO1 and is exported by XPO1 from the nucleus. Mutation of XIW1 reduces the induction of ABA-responsive genes and the accumulation of ABA Insensitive 5 (ABI5), causing mutant plants with ABA-insensitive phenotypes during seed germination and seedling growth, and decreased drought stress resistance. ABA treatment upregulates the expression of XIW1, and both ABA and abiotic stresses promote XIW1 accumulation in the nucleus, where it interacts with ABI5. Loss of XIW1 function results in rapid proteasomal degradation of ABI5. Taken together, these findings suggest that XIW1 is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein and plays a positive role in ABA responses by interacting with and maintaining the stability of ABI5 in the nucleus. © 2019 The Author
XIW1 was identified as a substrate for the nuclear transport receptor XPO1, and is exported from the nucleus in an XPO1-dependent manner. In the presence of abscisic acid, XIW1 accumulates in the nucleus, where it interacts with ABI5 and promotes ABI5 stability and ABA responses. © 2019 The Author},

abstract={RNA editing converting cytidines into uridines is a hallmark of gene expression in land plant chloroplasts and mitochondria. Pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins have a key role in target recognition, but the functional editosome in the plant organelles has remained elusive. Here we show that individual Physcomitrella patens DYW-type PPR proteins alone can perform efficient C-to-U editing in Escherichia coli reproducing the moss mitochondrial editing. Single amino acid exchanges in the DYW domain abolish RNA editing, confirming it as the functional cytidine deaminase. The modification of RNA targets and the identification of numerous off-targets in the E. coli transcriptome reveal nucleotide identities critical for RNA recognition and cytidine conversion. The straightforward amenability of the new E. coli setup will accelerate future studies on RNA target recognition through PPRs, on the C-to-U editing deamination machinery and towards future establishment of transcript editing in other genetic systems. © 2019, The Author(s).},

abstract={Maize kernel size and weight are essential contributors to its yield. So the identification of the genes controlling kernel size and weight can give us a chance to gain the yield. Here, we identified a small kernel mutant, Zea mays small kernel 9 (Zmsmk9), in maize. Cytological observation showed that the development of the endosperm and embryo was delayed in Zmsmk9 mutants at the early stages, resulting in a small kernel phenotype. Interestingly, despite substantial variation in kernel size, the germination of Zmsmk9 seeds was comparable to that of WT, and could develop into normal plants with upright leaf architecture. We cloned Zmsmk9 via map-based cloning. ZmSMK9 encodes a P-type pentatricopeptide repeat protein that targets to mitochondria, and is involved in RNA splicing in mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase5 (nad5) intron-1 and intron-4. Consistent with the delayed development phenotype, transcriptome analysis of 12-DAP endosperm showed that starch and zeins biosynthesis related genes were dramatically down regulated in Zmsmk9, while cell cycle and cell growth related genes were dramatically increased. As a result, ZmSMK9 is a novel gene required for the splicing of nad5 intron-1 and intron-4, kernel development, and plant architecture in maize. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={DNA hydroxymethylation is one of the major epigenetic mechanisms mediating the development of several human cancers. This study aimed to identify key hydroxymethylated genes and transcription factors (TFs) associated with alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)-negative hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using whole-genome DNA hydroxymethylation profiling. A total of 615 differentially hydroxymethylated regions (DHMRs) were identified from AFP-negative HCC tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues. DHMR-associated genes were significantly enriched in gene ontology functions associated with actin binding, cell leading edge, and blood vessel morphogenesis and pathways such as MAPK signaling pathway, neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, and axon guidance. Moreover, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis showed that PH domain and leucine-rich repeat protein phosphatase 1 (PHLPP1) and SWI/SNF related, matrix associated, actin dependent regulator of chromatin, subfamily A, member 2 (SMARCA2) had higher degrees and were hub nodes. Furthermore, TF prediction analysis showed that TFs, such as nuclear factor I C (NFIC) and GATA binding protein 3 (GATA3), regulated many DHMR-associated genes. Our findings reveal that key hydroxymethylated genes such as PHLPP1 and SMARCA2, as well as TFs such as NFIC and GATA, may be involved in the development of AFP-negative HCC. These molecules may be potential biomarkers for AFP-negative HCC. © Copyright 2019, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2019.},

abstract={Extensive studies have shown that the MBW complex consisting of three kinds of regulatory proteins, MYB and basic helix–loop–helix (bHLH) transcription factors and a WD40 repeat protein, TRANSPARENT TESTA GLABRA1 (TTG1), acts in concert to promote trichome formation and flavonoid accumulation in Arabidopsis thaliana. TTG1 functions as an essential activator in these two biological processes. However, direct downstream targets of the TTG1-dependent MBW complex have not yet been obtained in the two biological processes at the genome-wide level in A. thaliana. In the present study, we found, through RNA sequencing and quantitative real-time PCR analysis, that a great number of regulatory and structural genes involved in both trichome formation and flavonoid accumulation are significantly downregulated in the young shoots and expanding true leaves of ttg1-13 plants. Post-translational activation of a TTG1-glucocorticoid receptor fusion protein and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that these downregulated genes are directly or indirectly targeted by the TTG1-dependent MBW complex in vivo during trichome formation and flavonoid accumulation. These findings further extend our understanding of the role of TTG1-dependent MBW complex in the regulation of trichome formation and flavonoid accumulation in A. thaliana. © 2019 by the authors.

abstract={Purpose: The present study aimed to identify the molecular mechanism of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and explore valuable prognostic biomarkers for relapsed ALL. Methods: Gene expression dataset including 59 samples from ALL survivals without recurrence (good group)and 114 samples from dead ALL patients died of recurrence (poor group)was downloaded from TCGA database. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs)were identified between good and poor groups, followed by pathway and functional enrichment analyses. Subsequently, logistic regression model and survival analysis were performed. Results: In total, 637 up- and 578 down-regulated DEGs were revealed between good and poor groups. These DEGs were mainly enriched in functions including transcription and pathways like focal adhesion. Genes including alpha-protein kinase 1 (ALPK1), zinc finger protein 695 (ZNF695), actinin alpha 4 (ACTN4), calreticulin (CALR), and F-Box and leucine rich repeat protein 5 (FBXL5)were outstanding in survival analysis. Conclusion: Transcription and focal adhesion might play important roles in ALL progression. Furthermore, genes including ALPK1, ZNF695, ACTN4, CALR, and FBXL5 might be novel prognostic genes for relapsed ALL. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={The expression of chloroplast genes relies on a host of nucleus-encoded proteins. Identification of such proteins and elucidation of their functions are ongoing challenges. We used ribosome profiling to revisit the function of the pentatricopeptide repeat protein LPE1, reported to stimulate translation of the chloroplast psbA mRNA in Arabidopsis. Mutation of the maize LPE1 ortholog causes a photosystem II (PSII) deficiency and a defect in translation of the chloroplast psbJ open reading frame (ORF) but has no effect on psbA expression. To reflect this function, we named the maize LPE1 ortholog Translation of psbJ 1 (TPJ1). Arabidopsis lpe1 mutants likewise exhibit a loss of psbJ translation, and have, in addition, a decrease in psbN translation. We detected a small decrease in ribosome occupancy on the psbA mRNA in Arabidopsis lpe1 mutants, but ribosome profiling analyses of other PSII mutants (hcf107 and hcf173) in conjunction with in vitro RNA binding data strongly suggest that this is a secondary effect of their PSII deficiency. We conclude that maize TPJ1 promotes PSII synthesis by activating translation of the psbJ ORF, that this function is conserved in Arabidopsis LPE1, and that an additional role for LPE1 in psbN translation contributes to the PSII deficiency in lpe1 mutants. © 2019 The Authors The Plant Journal © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

abstract={Soil salinity globally affects the productivity of staple food crops. Therefore, an understanding of the molecular mechanisms that lead to salt tolerance induced by antioxidant mechanisms can assist in the development of salt-tolerant crops. To decipher the molecular fingerprint of salt resistance, in this study, six salt-tolerant cowpea genotypes at the seedling stage were assessed for their antioxidant responses, yield, genetic polymorphism and proteomics under salt stress. Leaves and roots showed distinct tissue-specific responses to salinity, and leaves showed a better protection against salt stress-induced oxidative stress than roots. Inter simple sequence repeat (ISSR) fingerprinting allowed molecular discrimination between salt-tolerant cowpea genotypes. Proteome analysis of cowpea leaves under salt stress revealed up-regulation of ATP synthase, vacuolar ATPase, pentatricopeptide repeat protein, flavanone 3-hydroxylase and outer envelope pore protein. Thus, ISSR and proteome analysis allow the identification of salt-tolerant cowpea cultivars. © 1996-2019.},

While type III PKS biosynthetic pathways have been studied thoroughly in plants, their counterparts from bacteria and fungi are to date scarcely characterized. This gap is exemplified by myxobacteria from which no type III PKS-derived small molecule has previously been isolated. In this study, we conducted a genomic survey of myxobacterial type III PKSs and report the identification of uncommon alkylpyrones as the products of type III PKS biosynthesis from the myxobacterial model strain Myxococcus xanthus DK1622 through a self-resistance-guided screening approach focusing on genes encoding pentapetide repeat proteins, proficient to confer resistance to topoisomerase inhibitors. Using promoter-induced gene expression in the native host as well as heterologous expression of biosynthetic type III PKS genes, sufficient amounts of material could be obtained for structural elucidation and bioactivity testing, revealing potent topoisomerase activity in vitro. © 2018, Society for Industrial Microbiology and Biotechnology.},

abstract={Hybrid breeding in sunflowers based on CMS PET1 requires development of restorer lines carrying, in most cases, the restorer gene Rf1. Markers for marker-assisted selection have been developed, but there is still need for closer, more versatile, and co-dominant markers linked to Rf1. Homology searches against the reference sunflower genome using sequences of cloned markers, as well as Bacterial Artificial Chromosome (BAC)-end sequences of clones hybridizing to them, allowed the identification of two genomic regions of 30 and 3.9 Mb, respectively, as possible physical locations of the restorer gene Rf1 on linkage group 13. Nine potential candidate genes, encoding six pentatricopeptide repeat proteins, one tetratricopeptide-like helical domain, a probable aldehyde dehydrogenase 22A1, and a probable poly(A) polymerase 3 (PAPS3), were identified in these two genomic regions. Amplicon targeted next generation sequencing of these nine candidate genes for Rf1 was performed in an association panel consisting of 27 maintainer and 32 restorer lines and revealed the presence of 210 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) and 67 Insertions/Deletions (INDELs). Association studies showed significant associations of 10 SNPs with fertility restoration (p-value &lt; 10−4 ), narrowing Rf1 down to three candidate genes. Three new markers, one co-dominant marker 67N04_P and two dominant markers, PPR621.5R for restorer, and PPR621.5M for maintainer lines were developed and verified in the association panel of 59 sunflower lines. The versatility of the three newly developed markers, as well as of three existing markers for the restorer gene Rf1 (HRG01 and HRG02, Cleaved Amplified Polymorphic Sequence (CAPS)-marker H13), was analyzed in a large association panel consisting of 557 accessions. © 2019 by the authors.

Dysregulation of MLL1 catalytic function is relevant to mixed-lineage leukemia, and targeting WDR5-MLL1 interaction could be a promising therapeutic strategy for leukemia harboring MLL1 fusion proteins. To date, several peptidomimetic and non-peptidomimetic small-molecule inhibitors targeting WDR5-MLL1 interaction have been reported, yet the discovery walk of new drugs inhibiting MLL1 methytransferase activity is still in its infancy. It's urgent to find other small-molecule WDR5-MLL1 inhibitors with novel scaffolds. In this study, through fluorescence polarization (FP)-based high throughput screening, several small-molecule inhibitors with potent inhibitory activities in vitro against WDR5-MLL1 interaction were discovered. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) assays were carried out to confirm the direct binding between hit compounds and WDR5. Subsequent similarity-based analog searching of the 4 hits led to several inhibitors with better activity, among them, DC_M5_2 displayed highest inhibitory activity with IC50 values of 9.63 ± 1.46 µM.

abstract={Legionella pneumophila is a freshwater bacterium that replicates in predatory amoeba and alveolar macrophage. The ability of L. pneumophila to thrive in eukaryotic host cells is conferred by the Legionella containing vacuole (LCV). Formation and intracellular trafficking of the LCV are governed by an arsenal of effector proteins, many of which are secreted by the Icm/Dot Type 4 Secretion System. One such effector, known as LpnE (L. pneumophila Entry), has been implicated in facilitating bacterial entry into host cells, LCV trafficking, and substrate translocation. LpnE belongs to a subfamily of tetratricopeptide repeat proteins known as Sel1-like repeats (SLRs). All eight of the predicted SLRs in LpnE are required to promote host cell invasion. Herein, we report that LpnE(1-375) localizes to cis-Golgi in HEK293 cells via its signal peptide (aa 1–22). We further verify the interaction of LpnE(73-375) and LpnE(22-375) with Oculocerebrorenal syndrome of Lowe protein (OCRL) residues 10–208, restricting the known interacting residues for both proteins. To further characterize the SLR region of LpnE, we solved the crystal structure of LpnE(73-375) to 1.75Å resolution. This construct comprises all SLRs, which are arranged in a superhelical fold. The α-helices forming the inner concave surface of the LpnE superhelix suggest a potential protein–protein interaction interface.

abstract={Background: Many small peptides regulate eukaryotic cell biology. In fungi, some of these peptides are produced after KEX2 protease activity on proteins displaying repetitions of identical or nearly identical motifs. Following this endoprotease activity, peptides are released in the extracellular space. This type of protein maturation is involved in the production of the α-type sexual pheromone in Ascomycota. In other cases, this processing allows the production of secreted peptides regulating fungal cell wall structure or acting as mycotoxins. In this work, we report for the first time a genome-wide search of KEX2-processed repeat proteins that we call KEPs. We screened the secreted proteins of 250 fungal species to compare their KEP repertoires with regard to their lifestyle, morphology or lineage. Results: Our analysis points out that nearly all fungi display putative KEPs, suggesting an ancestral origin common to all opisthokonts. As expected, our pipeline identifies mycotoxins but also α-type sexual pheromones in Ascomycota that have not been explored so far, and unravels KEP-derived secreted peptides of unknown functions. Some species display an expansion of this class of proteins. Interestingly, we identified conserved KEPs in pathogenic fungi, suggesting a role in virulence. We also identified KEPs in Basidiomycota with striking similarities to Ascomycota α-type sexual pheromones, suggesting they may also play alternative roles in unknown signalling processes. Conclusions: We identified putative, new, unexpected secreted peptides that fall into different functional categories: mycotoxins, hormones, sexual pheromones, or effectors that promote colonization during host-microbe interactions. This wide survey will open new avenues in the field of small-secreted peptides in fungi that are critical regulators of their intimate biology and modulators of their interaction with the environment. © 2019 The Author(s).},

abstract={Background: Anthocyanins are water-soluble colored flavonoids present in multiple organs of various plant species including flowers, fruits, leaves, stems and roots. DNA-binding R2R3-MYB transcription factors, basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors, and WD40 repeat proteins are known to form MYB-bHLH-WD repeat (MBW) complexes, which activates the transcription of structural genes in the anthocyanin pathway. Although black cultivars of carrots (Daucus carota L.) can accumulate large quantities of anthocyanin in their storage roots, the regulatory genes responsible for their biosynthesis are not well characterized. The current study aimed to analyze global transcription profiles based on RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq), and mine MYB, bHLH and WD40 genes that may function as positive or negative regulators in the carrot anthocyanin biosynthesis pathways. Results: RNA was isolated from differently colored calli, as well as tissue samples from taproots of various black carrot cultivars across the course of development, and gene expression levels of colored and non-colored tissue and callus samples were compared. The expression of 32 MYB, bHLH and WD40 genes were significantly correlated with anthocyanin content in black carrot taproot. Of those, 11 genes were consistently up- or downregulated in a purple color-specific manner across various calli and cultivar comparisons. The expression of 10 out of these 11 genes was validated using real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Conclusions: The results of this study provide insights into regulatory genes that may be responsible for carrot anthocyanin biosynthesis, and suggest that future focus on them may help improve our overall understanding of the anthocyanin synthesis pathway. © 2018 The Author(s).},

abstract={Delivering genes selectively to the therapeutically relevant cell type is among the prime goals of vector development. Here, we present a high-throughput selection and screening process that identifies designed ankyrin repeat proteins (DARPins) optimally suited for receptor-targeted gene delivery using adeno-associated viral (AAV) and lentiviral (LV) vectors. In particular, the process includes expression, purification, and in situ biotinylation of the extracellular domains of target receptors as Fc fusion proteins in mammalian cells and the selection of high-affinity binders by ribosome display from DARPin libraries each covering more than 1012 variants. This way, DARPins specific for the glutamate receptor subunit GluA4, the endothelial surface marker CD105, and the natural killer cell marker NKp46 were generated. The identification of DARPins best suited for gene delivery was achieved by screening small-scale vector productions. Both LV and AAV particles displaying the selected DARPins transduced only cells expressing the corresponding target receptor. The data confirm that a straightforward process for the generation of receptor-targeted viral vectors has been established. Moreover, biochemical analysis of a panel of DARPins revealed that their functional cell-surface expression as fusion proteins is more relevant for efficient gene delivery by LV particles than functional binding affinity. © 2018 The Authors},

abstract={RNA-RNA interactions are key mechanisms through which noncoding RNA (ncRNA) regions exert biological functions. Computational prediction of RNA-RNA interactions is an essential method for detecting novel RNA-RNA interactions because their comprehensive detection by biological experimentation is still quite difficult. Many RNA-RNA interaction prediction tools have been developed, but they tend to produce many false positives. Accordingly, assessment of the statistical significance of computationally predicted interactions is an important task. However, there is no method to evaluate the statistical significance of RNA-RNA interactions that is applicable to interactions between two long RNA sequences. We developed a method to calculate the p-value for the minimal interaction energy between two long RNA sequences. The developed method depends on the fact that minimum interaction energies of RNA-RNA interactions between long RNAs follow a Gumbel distribution when repeat sequences in RNAs are masked. To show the usefulness of the developed method, we applied it to whole human 5′-untranslated region (UTR) and 3′-UTR sequences to detect novel 5′-UTR-3′-UTR interactions. We thus identified two significant 5′-UTR-3′-UTR interactions. Specifically, the human small proline-rich repeat protein 3 shows conserved 5′-UTR-3′-UTR interactions with some nucleotide variations preserving base pairings among primates. Our developed method enables us to detect statistically significant RNA-RNA interactions between long RNAs such as long ncRNAs. Statistical significance estimates help in identification of interactions for experimental validation and provide novel insights into the function of ncRNA regions. © Copyright 2018, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2018.},

abstract={The ankyrin repeat (AR) structure is a common protein–protein interaction motif and ankyrin repeat proteins comprise a vast family across a large array of different taxa. Natural AR proteins adopt a conserved fold comprised of several repeats with the N- and C-terminal repeats generally being of more divergent sequences. Obtaining experimental crystal structures for natural ankyrin repeat domains (ARD) can be difficult and often requires complexation with a binding partner. Homology modeling is an attractive method for creating a model of AR proteins due to the highly conserved fold; however, modeling the divergent N- and C-terminal “capping” repeats remains a challenge. We show here that amide hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS), which reports on the presence of secondary structural elements and “foldedness,” can aid in the refinement and selection of AR protein homology models when multiple templates are identified with variations between them localizing to these terminal repeats. We report a homology model for the AR protein IκBε from three different templates and use HDX-MS to establish the presence of a seventh AR at the C-terminus identified by only one of the three templates used for modeling. © 2018 The Protein Society},

abstract={RepeatsDB-lite (http://protein.bio.unipd.it/repeatsdb-lite) is a web server for the prediction of repetitive structural elements and units in tandem repeat (TR) proteins. TRs are a widespread but poorly annotated class of non-globular proteins carrying heterogeneous functions. RepeatsDB-lite extends the prediction to all TR types and strongly improves the performance both in terms of computational time and accuracy over previous methods, with precision above 95% for solenoid structures. The algorithm exploits an improved TR unit library derived from the RepeatsDB database to perform an iterative structural search and assignment. The web interface provides tools for analyzing the evolutionary relationships between units and manually refine the prediction by changing unit positions and protein classification. An all-against-all structure-based sequence similarity matrix is calculated and visualized in real-time for every user edit. Reviewed predictions can be submitted to RepeatsDB for review and inclusion. © The Author(s) 2018. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.},

abstract={The current study evaluated exosomes isolated from plasma of heifers bred to have high or low fertility through developing extreme diversity in fertility breeding values, however, key animal traits (e.g., body weight, milk production, and percentage of North American genetics) remained similar between the 2 groups. The exosomes were isolated by a combined ultracentrifugation and size exclusion chromatography approach and characterized by their size distribution (nanoparticle tracking analysis), morphology (transmission electron microscopy), and presence of exosomal markers (immunoblotting). In addition, a targeted mass spectrometry approach was used to confirm the presence of 2 exosomal markers, tumor susceptibility gene 101 and flotillin 1. The number of exosomes from plasma of high fertility heifers was greater compared with low fertility heifers. Interestingly, the exosomal proteomic profile, evaluated using mass spectrometry, identified 89 and 116 proteins in the high and low fertility heifers respectively, of which 4 and 31 were unique, respectively. These include proteins associated with specific biological processes and molecular functions of fertility. Most notably, the tetratricopeptide repeat protein 41-related, glycodelin, and kelch-like protein 8 were identified in plasma exosomes unique to the low fertility heifers. These proteins are suggested to play a role in reproduction; however, the role of these proteins in dairy cow reproduction remains to be elucidated. Their identification underscores the potential for proteins within exosomes to provide information on the fertility status and physiological condition of the cow. This may potentially lead to the development of prognostic tools and interventions to improving dairy cow fertility. © 2018 American Dairy Science Association},

abstract={Background: WD40 repeat proteins constitute one of the largest families in eukaryotes, and widely participate in various fundamental cellular processes by interacting with other molecules. Based on individual WD40 proteins, previous work has demonstrated that their structural characteristics should confer great potential of interaction and complex formation, and has speculated that they may serve as hubs in the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. However, what roles the whole family plays in organizing the PPI network, and whether this information can be utilized in complex prediction remain unclear. To address these issues, quantitative and systematic analyses of WD40 proteins from the perspective of PPI networks are highly required. Results: In this work, we built two human PPI networks by using data sets with different confidence levels, and studied the network properties of the whole human WD40 protein family systematically. Our analyses have quantitatively confirmed that the human WD40 protein family, as a whole, tends to be hubs with an odds ratio of about 1.8 or greater, and the network decomposition has revealed that they are prone to enrich near the global center of the whole network with a fold change of two in the median k-values. By integrating expression profiles, we have further shown that WD40 hub proteins are inclined to be intramodular, which is indicative of complex assembling. Based on this information, we have further predicted 1674 potential WD40-associated complexes by choosing a clique-based method, which is more sensitive than others, and an indirect evaluation by co-expression scores has demonstrated its reliability. Conclusions: At the systems level but not sporadic examples' level, this work has provided rich knowledge for better understanding WD40 proteins' roles in organizing the PPI network. These findings and predicted complexes can offer valuable clues for prioritizing candidates for further studies. © 2018 The Author(s).},

abstract={Autosomal-dominant, missense mutations in the leucine-rich repeat protein kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene are the most common genetic predisposition to develop Parkinson’s disease (PD). LRRK2 kinase activity is increased in several pathogenic mutations (N1437H, R1441C/G/H, Y1699C, G2019S), implicating hyperphosphorylation of a substrate in the pathogenesis of the disease. Identification of the downstream targets of LRRK2 is a crucial endeavor in the field to understand LRRK2 pathway dysfunction in the disease. We have identified the signaling adapter protein p62/SQSTM1 as a novel endogenous interacting partner and a substrate of LRRK2. Using mass spectrometry and phospho-specific antibodies, we found that LRRK2 phosphorylates p62 on Thr138 in vitro and in cells. We found that the pathogenic LRRK2 PD-associated mutations (N1437H, R1441C/G/H, Y1699C, G2019S) increase phosphorylation of p62 similar to previously reported substrate Rab proteins. Notably, we found that the pathogenic I2020T mutation and the risk factor mutation G2385R displayed decreased phosphorylation of p62. p62 phosphorylation by LRRK2 is blocked by treatment with selective LRRK2 inhibitors in cells. We also found that the amino-terminus of LRRK2 is crucial for optimal phosphorylation of Rab7L1 and p62 in cells. LRRK2 phosphorylation of Thr138 is dependent on a p62 functional ubiquitin-binding domain at its carboxy-terminus. Co-expression of p62 with LRRK2 G2019S increases the neurotoxicity of this mutation in a manner dependent on Thr138. p62 is an additional novel substrate of LRRK2 that regulates its toxic biology, reveals novel signaling nodes and can be used as a pharmacodynamic marker for LRRK2 kinase activity. © 2018 The Author(s).},

abstract={Wheat stem rust, caused by Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici (Pgt), is a devastating foliar disease. The Ug99 race group has combined virulence to most stem rust (Sr) resistance genes deployed in wheat and is a threat to global wheat production. Here we identified a coiled-coil, nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat protein (NLR) completely linked to the Ug99 resistance gene Sr21 from Triticum monococcum. Loss-of-function mutations and transgenic complementation confirmed that this gene is Sr21. Sr21 transcripts were significantly higher at high temperatures, and this was associated with significant upregulation of pathogenesis related (PR) genes and increased levels of resistance at those temperatures. Introgression of Sr21 into hexaploid wheat resulted in lower levels of resistance than in diploid wheat, but transgenic hexaploid wheat lines with high levels of Sr21 expression showed high levels of resistance. Sr21 can be a valuable component of transgenic cassettes or gene pyramids combining multiple resistance genes against Ug99. © 2018 Chen et al.},

abstract={Hemerythrin-like proteins have generally been studied for their ability to reversibly bind oxygen through their binuclear nonheme iron centers. However, in recent years, it has become increasingly evident that some members of the hemerythrin-like superfamily also participate in many other biological processes. For instance, the binuclear nonheme iron site of YtfE, a hemerythrin-like protein involved in the repair of iron centers in Escherichia coli, catalyzes the reduction of nitric oxide to nitrous oxide, and the human F-box/LRR-repeat protein 5, which contains a hemerythrin-like domain, is involved in intracellular iron homeostasis. Furthermore, structural data on hemerythrin-like domains from two proteins of unknown function, PF0695 from Pyrococcus furiosus and NMB1532 from Neisseria meningitidis, show that the cation-binding sites, typical of hemerythrin, can be absent or be occupied by metal ions other than iron. To systematically investigate this functional and structural diversity of the hemerythrin-like superfamily, we have collected hemerythrin-like sequences from a database comprising fully sequenced proteomes and generated a cluster map based on their all-against-all pairwise sequence similarity. Our results show that the hemerythrin-like superfamily comprises a large number of protein families which can be classified into three broad groups on the basis of their cation-coordinating residues: (a) signal-transduction and oxygen-carrier hemerythrins (H-HxxxE-HxxxH-HxxxxD); (b) hemerythrin-like (H-HxxxE-H-HxxxE); and, (c) metazoan F-box proteins (H-HExxE-H-HxxxE). Interestingly, all but two hemerythrin-like families exhibit internal sequence and structural symmetry, suggesting that a duplication event may have led to the origin of the hemerythrin domain. © 2018 The Protein Society},

abstract={Armadillo repeat family is well-characterized in several plant species for their involvement in multiple regulatory processes including growth, development, and stress response. We have previously shown a three-fold higher expression of ARM protein-encoding in tomato cultivar tolerant to tomato leaf curl New Delhi virus (ToLCNDV) compared to susceptible cultivar upon virus infection. This suggests the putative involvement of ARM proteins in defense response against virus infection; however, no comprehensive investigation has been performed to address this inference. In the present study, we have identified a total of 46 ARM-repeat proteins (SlARMs), and 41 U-box-containing proteins (SlPUBs) in tomato. These proteins and their corresponding genes were studied for their physicochemical properties, gene structure, domain architecture, chromosomal localization, phylogeny, and cis-regulatory elements in the upstream promoter region. Expression profiling of candidate genes in response to ToLCNDV infection in contrasting tomato cultivars showed significant upregulation of SlARM18 in the tolerant cultivar. Virus-induced gene silencing of SlARM18 in the tolerant tomato cultivar conferred susceptibility, which suggests the involvement of this gene in resistance mechanism. Further studies are underway to functionally characterize SlARM18 to delineate its precise role in defense mechanism. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Background: The plant immune system is innate and encoded in the germline. Using it efficiently, plants are capable of recognizing a diverse range of rapidly evolving pathogens. A recently described phenomenon shows that plant immune receptors are able to recognize pathogen effectors through the acquisition of exogenous protein domains from other plant genes. Results: We show that plant immune receptors with integrated domains are distributed unevenly across their phylogeny in grasses. Using phylogenetic analysis, we uncover a major integration clade, whose members underwent repeated independent integration events producing diverse fusions. This clade is ancestral in grasses with members often found on syntenic chromosomes. Analyses of these fusion events reveals that homologous receptors can be fused to diverse domains. Furthermore, we discover a 43 amino acid long motif associated with this dominant integration clade which is located immediately upstream of the fusion site. Sequence analysis reveals that DNA transposition and/or ectopic recombination are the most likely mechanisms of formation for nucleotide binding leucine rich repeat proteins with integrated domains. Conclusions: The identification of this subclass of plant immune receptors that is naturally adapted to new domain integration will inform biotechnological approaches for generating synthetic receptors with novel pathogen "baits." © 2018 The Author(s).},

abstract={In recent years, a number of new protein structures that possess tandem repeats have emerged. Many of these proteins are comprised of tandem arrays of β-hairpins. Today, the amount and variety of the data on these β-hairpin repeat (BHR) structures have reached a level that requires detailed analysis and further classification. In this paper, we classified the BHR proteins, compared structures, sequences of repeat motifs, functions and distribution across the major taxonomic kingdoms of life and within organisms. As a result, we identified six different BHR folds in tandem repeat proteins of Class III (elongated structures) and one BHR fold (up-and-down β-barrel) in Class IV (“closed” structures). Our survey reveals the high incidence of the BHR proteins among bacteria and viruses and their possible relationship to the structures of amyloid fibrils. It indicates that BHR folds will be an attractive target for future structural studies, especially in the context of age-related amyloidosis and emerging infectious diseases. This work allowed us to update the RepeatsDB database, which contains annotated tandem repeat protein structures and to construct sequence profiles based on BHR structural alignments. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={As described in the literature, Solieria filiformis lectin (SfL) from the marine red alga S. filiformis was found to have antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory effects. In this study, we characterized two SfL variants, SfL-1 and SfL-2, with molecular mass of 27,552 Da and 27,985 Da, respectively. The primary structures of SfL-1 and SfL-2 consist of four tandem-repeat protein domains with 67 amino acids each. SfL-1 and -2 showed high similarity to OAAH-family lectins. 3D structure prediction revealed that SfL-1 and -2 are composed of two β-barrel-like domains formed by five antiparallel β-strands, which are connected by a short peptide linker. Furthermore, the mixture of isoforms (SfLs) showed anticancer effect against MCF-7 cells. Specifically, SfLs inhibited 50% of viability in MCF-7 cells after treatment at 125 μg.mL−1, while the inhibition of Human Dermal Fibroblasts (HDF) was 34% with the same treatment. Finally, 24 h after treatment, 25% of MCF-7 cells were in early apoptosis and 35% in late apoptosis. Evaluation of pro- and anti-apoptotic gene expression of MCF-7 cells revealed that SfLs induced caspase-dependent apoptosis within 24 h. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Gene expression in mitochondria of Plasmodium falciparum is essential for parasite survival. The molecular mechanisms of Plasmodium organellar gene expression remain poorly understood. This includes the enigmatic assembly of the mitochondrial ribosome from highly fragmented rRNAs. Here, we present the identification of clustered organellar short RNA fragments (cosRNAs) that are possible footprints of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) in Plasmodium organelles. In plants, RBPs of the pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) class produce footprints as a consequence of their function in processing organellar RNAs. Intriguingly, many of the Plasmodium cosRNAs overlap with 5-ends of rRNA fragments. We hypothesize that these are footprints of RBPs involved in assembling the rRNA fragments into a functioning ribosome. A bioinformatics search of the Plasmodium nuclear genome identified a hitherto unrecognized organellar helical-hairpin-repeat protein family that we term heptatricopeptide repeat (HPR) proteins. We demonstrate that selected HPR proteins are targeted to mitochondria in P. berghei and that one of them, PbHPR1, associates with RNA, but not DNA in vitro. A phylogenetic search identified HPR proteins in a wide variety of eukaryotes. We hypothesize that HPR proteins are required for processing and stabilizing RNAs in Apicomplexa and other taxa. © The Author(s) 2018.

A total of 579, 318, and 313 WD40 genes were found in Gossypium hirsutum, G. arboreum, and G. raimondii, respectively. Based on phylogenetic tree analyses, WD40 genes were divided into 11 groups with high similarities in exon/intron features and protein domains within the group. Expression analysis of WD40 genes showed differential expression at different stages of cotton fiber development (0 and 8 DPA) and cotton stem. A number of miRNAs were identified to target WD40 genes that are significantly involved in cotton fiber development during the initiation and elongation stages. These include miR156, miR160, miR162, miR164, miR166, miR167, miR169, miR171, miR172, miR393, miR396, miR398, miR2950, and miR7505.

RNA editing leads to re-establishment of conserved amino acid residues for functional proteins in nuclei, chloroplasts, and mitochondria.

Significant progress has been made in recent years in RNA editing studies for both animal and plant cells. RNA editing in nuclei and mitochondria of animal cells and in chloroplast of plant cells has been extensively documented and reviewed. RNA editing has been also extensively documented on plant mitochondria. However, functional diversity of RNA editing factors in plant mitochondria is not overviewed. Here, we review the biological significance of RNA editing, recent progress on the molecular mechanisms of RNA editing process, and function diversity of editing factors in plant mitochondrial research. We will focus on: (1) pentatricopeptide repeat proteins in Arabidopsis and in crop plants; (2) the progress of RNA editing process in plant mitochondria; (3) RNA editing-related RNA splicing; (4) RNA editing associated flower development; (5) RNA editing modulated male sterile; (6) RNA editing-regulated cell signaling; and (7) RNA editing involving abiotic stress. Advances described in this review will be valuable in expanding our understanding in RNA editing. The diverse functions of RNA editing in plant mitochondria will shed light on the investigation of molecular mechanisms that underlies plant development and abiotic stress tolerance. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Leptospirosis is an important zoonotic disease, and the major outbreak of this disease in Thailand in 1999 was due largely to the Leptospira borgpetersenii serovar Sejroe. Identification of the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) LBJ_2271 protein containing immunogenic epitopes and the discovery of the LBJ_2271 ortholog in Leptospira serovar Sejroe, KU_Sej_R21_2271, led to further studies of the antigenic immune properties of KU_Sej_LRR_2271. The recombinant hybrid (rh) protein was created and expressed from a hybrid PCR fragment of KU_Sej_R21_2271 fused with DNA encoding the LBJ_2271 signal sequence for targeting protein as a membrane-anchoring protein. The fusion DNA was cloned into pET160/GW/D-TOPO® to form the pET160_hKU_R21_2271 plasmid. The plasmid was used to express the rhKU_Sej_LRR_2271 protein in Escherichia coli BL21 Star™ (DE3). The expressed protein was immunologically detected by Western blotting and immunoreactivity detection with hyperimmune sera, T cell epitope prediction by HLA allele and epitope peptide binding affinity, and potential T cell reactivity analysis. The immunogenic epitopes of the protein were evaluated and verified by HLA allele and epitope peptide complex structure molecular docking. Among fourteen best allele epitopes of this protein, binding affinity values of 12 allele epitopes remained unchanged compared to LBJ_2271. Two epitopes for alleles HLA-A0202 and -A0301 had higher IC50 values, while T cell reactivity values of these peptides were better than values from LBJ_2271 epitopes. Eight of twelve epitope peptides had positive T-cell reactivity scores. Although the molecular docking of two epitopes, 3FPLLKEFLV11/47FPLLKEFLV55 and 50KLSTVPEGV58, into an HLA-A0202 model revealed a good fit in the docked structures, 50KLSTVPEGV58 and 94KLSTVPEEV102 are still considered as the proteins' best epitopes for allele HLA-A0202. The results of this study showed that rhKU_Sej_LRR_2271 protein contained natural immunological properties that should be further examined with respect to antigenic immune stimulation for vaccine development to prevent prevalent leptospiral serovar infection in Thailand. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Epigenetic memory in Norway spruce affects the timing of bud burst and bud set, vitally important adaptive traits for this long-lived forest species. Epigenetic memory is established in response to the temperature conditions during embryogenesis. Somatic embryogenesis at different epitype inducing (EpI) temperatures closely mimics the natural processes of epigenetic memory formation in seeds, giving rise to epigenetically different clonal plants in a reproducible and predictable manner, with respect to altered bud phenology. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) and other small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs) play an essential role in the regulation of plant gene expression and may affect this epigenetic mechanism. We used NGS sequencing and computational in silico methods to identify and profile conserved and novel miRNAs among small RNAs in embryogenic tissues of Norway spruce at three EpI temperatures (18, 23 and 28°C). We detected three predominant classes of sRNAs related to a length of 24 nt, followed by a 21-22 nt class and a third 31 nt class of sRNAs. More than 2100 different miRNAs within the prevailing length 21-22 nt were identified. Profiling these putative miRNAs allowed identification of 1053 highly expressed miRNAs, including 523 conserved and 530 novels. 654 of these miRNAs were found to be differentially expressed (DEM) depending on EpI temperature. For most DEMs, we defined their putative mRNA targets. The targets represented mostly by transcripts of multiple-repeats proteins, like TIR, NBS-LRR, PPR and TPR repeat, Clathrin/VPS proteins, Myb-like, AP2, etc. Notably, 124 DE miRNAs targeted 203 differentially expressed epigenetic regulators. Developing Norway spruce embryos possess a more complex sRNA structure than that reported for somatic tissues. A variety of the predicted miRNAs showed distinct EpI temperature dependent expression patterns. These putative EpI miRNAs target spruce genes with a wide range of functions, including genes known to be involved in epigenetic regulation, which in turn could provide a feedback process leading to the formation of epigenetic marks. We suggest that TIR, NBS and LRR domain containing proteins could fulfill more general functions for signal transduction from external environmental stimuli and conversion them into molecular response.

abstract={Ecophysiological studies in Eucalyptus have shown that water is the principal factor limiting stem growth. Effect of water deficit conditions on physiological and biochemical parameters has been extensively reported in Eucalyptus. The present study was conducted to identify major polyethylene glycol induced water stress responsive transcripts in Eucalyptus grandis using gene co-expression network. A customized array representing 3359 water stress responsive genes was designed to document their expression in leaves of E. grandis cuttings subjected to − 0.225 MPa of PEG treatment. The differentially expressed transcripts were documented and significantly co-expressed transcripts were used for construction of network. The co-expression network was constructed with 915 nodes and 3454 edges with degree ranging from 2 to 45. Ninety four GO categories and 117 functional pathways were identified in the network. MCODE analysis generated 27 modules and module 6 with 479 nodes and 1005 edges was identified as the biologically relevant network. The major water responsive transcripts represented in the module included dehydrin, osmotin, LEA protein, expansin, arabinogalactans, heat shock proteins, major facilitator proteins, ARM repeat proteins, raffinose synthase, tonoplast intrinsic protein and transcription factors like DREB2A, ARF9, AGL24, UNE12, WLIM1 and MYB66, MYB70, MYB 55, MYB 16 and MYB 103. The coordinated analysis of gene expression patterns and coexpression networks developed in this study identified an array of transcripts that may regulate PEG induced water stress responses in E. grandis. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Natural protein sequences contain a record of their history. A common constraint in a given protein family is the ability to fold to specific structures, and it has been shown possible to infer the main native ensemble by analyzing covariations in extant sequences. Still, many natural proteins that fold into the same structural topology show different stabilization energies, and these are often related to their physiological behavior. We propose a description for the energetic variation given by sequence modifications in repeat proteins, systems for which the overall problem is simplified by their inherent symmetry. We explicitly account for single amino acid and pair-wise interactions and treat higher order correlations with a single term. We show that the resulting evolutionary field can be interpreted with structural detail. We trace the variations in the energetic scores of natural proteins and relate them to their experimental characterization. The resulting energetic evolutionary field allows the prediction of the folding free energy change for several mutants, and can be used to generate synthetic sequences that are statistically indistinguishable from the natural counterparts. © 2017 Espada et al.},

abstract={Key message: qFS07.1 controlling fiber strength was fine-mapped to a 62.6-kb region containing four annotated genes. RT-qPCR and sequence of candidate genes identified an LRR RLK gene as the most likely candidate. Abstract: Fiber strength is an important component of cotton fiber quality and is associated with other properties, such as fiber maturity, fineness, and length. Stable QTL qFS07.1, controlling fiber strength, had been identified on chromosome 7 in an upland cotton recombinant inbred line (RIL) population from a cross (CCRI35 × Yumian1) described in our previous studies. To fine-map qFS07.1, an F2 population with 2484 individual plants from a cross between recombinant line RIL014 and CCRI35 was established. A total of 1518 SSR primer pairs, including 1062, designed from chromosome 1 of the Gossypium raimondii genome and 456 from chromosome 1 of the G. arboreum genome (corresponding to the QTL region) were used to fine-map qFS07.1, and qFS07.1 was mapped into a 62.6-kb genome region which contained four annotated genes on chromosome A07 of G. hirsutum. RT-qPCR and comparative analysis of candidate genes revealed a leucine-rich repeat protein kinase (LRR RLK) family protein to be a promising candidate gene for qFS07.1. Fine mapping and identification of the candidate gene for qFS07.1 will play a vital role in marker-assisted selection (MAS) and the study of mechanism of cotton fiber development. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Background: There are many computational approaches to predict the protein-protein interactions using support vector machines (SVMs) with high performance. In fact, performance of currently reported methods are significantly over-estimated and affected by the object repetitiveness in the datasets used. Objective: To study the effect of object repetitiveness of datasets on predicting results. Method: We present novel methods to construct different positive datasets with or without repeating proteins using graph maximum matching in the protein-protein interaction datasets and corresponding series of negative datasets with different proteins repetitiveness are constructed using graph adjacency matrix. The relationship between the SVM prediction results and the repeated proteins (repeat numbers and repeat rates) and the distributions of repeated proteins in the datasets are analyzed. Results: Protein repetitiveness of positive and negative datasets can affect the prediction result: high protein repetitiveness of positive or negative datasets yield high performance prediction result. Conclusion: This indicate that dealing with object repetitiveness of datasets is a key issue in protein-protein interactions prediction using SVMs since real world data contain certain degrees of repeat proteins. © Copyright 2017, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2017.},

abstract={We report the partial complementation and subsequent comparative molecular analysis of two nonviable mutants impaired in chloroplast translation, one (emb2394) lacking the RPL6 protein, and the other (emb2654) carrying a mutation in a gene encoding a P-class pentatricopeptide repeat protein. We show that EMB2654 is required for the trans-splicing of the plastid rps12 transcript and that therefore the emb2654 mutant lacks Rps12 protein and fails to assemble the small subunit of the plastid ribosome, explaining the loss of plastid translation and consequent embryo-lethal phenotype. Predictions of the EMB2654 binding site match a small RNA “footprint” located on the 59 half of the trans-spliced intron that is almost absent in the partially complemented mutant. EMB2654 binds sequence specifically to this target sequence in vitro. Altered patterns in nucleaseprotected small RNA fragments in emb2654 show that EMB2654 binding must be an early step in, or prior to, the formation of a large protein-RNA complex covering the free ends of the two rps12 intron halves. © 2017 American Society of Plant Biologists.

abstract={The superfamily of armadillo repeat proteins is a fascinating archetype of modular-binding proteins involved in various fundamental cellular processes, including cell–cell adhesion, cytoskeletal organization, nuclear import, and molecular signaling. Despite their diverse functions, they all share tandem armadillo (ARM) repeats, which stack together to form a conserved three-dimensional structure. This superhelical armadillo structure enables them to interact with distinct partners by wrapping around them. Despite the important functional roles of this superfamily, a comprehensive analysis of the composition, classification, and phylogeny of this protein superfamily has not been reported. Furthermore, relatively little is known about a subset of ARM proteins, and some of the current annotations of armadillo repeats are incomplete or incorrect, often due to high similarity with HEAT repeats. We identified the entire armadillo repeat superfamily repertoire in the human genome, annotated each armadillo repeat, and performed an extensive evolutionary analysis of the armadillo repeat proteins in both metazoan and premetazoan species. Phylogenetic analyses of the superfamily classified them into several discrete branches with members showing significant sequence homology, and often also related functions. Interestingly, the phylogenetic structure of the superfamily revealed that about 30 % of the members predate metazoans and represent an ancient subset, which is gradually evolving to acquire complex and highly diverse functions. © 2016, Springer International Publishing.},

RepeatsDB 2.0 features information on start and end positions for the repeat regions and units for all entries. The extensive growth of repeat unit characterization was possible by applying the novel ReUPred annotation method over the entire Protein Data Bank, with data quality is guaranteed by an extensive manual validation for >60% of the entries. The updated web interface includes a new search engine for complex queries and a fully re-designed entry page for a better overview of structural data. It is now possible to compare unit positions, together with secondary structure, fold information and Pfam domains.

abstract={Pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins comprise a large family of helical repeat proteins that influence gene expression in mitochondria and chloroplasts. PPR tracts can bind RNA via a modular one repeat-one nucleotide mechanism in which the nucleotide is specified by the identities of several amino acids in each repeat. This mode of recognition, the so-called PPR code, offers opportunities for the prediction of native PPR binding sites and the design of proteins to bind specified RNAs. However, a deep understanding of the parameters that dictate the affinity and specificity of PPR-RNA interactions is necessary to realize these goals. We report a comprehensive analysis of the sequence specificity of PPR10, a protein that binds similar RNA sequences of ∼18 nucleotides (nt) near the chloroplast atpH and psaJ genes in maize. We assessed the contribution of each nucleotide in the atpH binding site to PPR10 affinity in vitro by analyzing the effects of single-nucleotide changes at each position. In a complementary approach, the RNAs bound by PPR10 from partially randomized RNA pools were analyzed by deep sequencing. The results revealed three patches in which nucleotide identity has a major impact on binding affinity. These include 5 nt for which protein contacts were not observed in a PPR10-RNA crystal structure and 4 nt that are not explained by current views of the PPR code. These findings highlight aspects of PPR-RNA interactions that pose challenges for binding site prediction and design. © 2017 Kang et al.},

abstract={Background: Pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins are encoded by a large gene family of approximately 450 members in Arabidopsis and 477 in rice, which characterized by tandem repetitions of a degenerate 35 amino acid characteristic sequence motifs. A large majority of the PPR genes in the higher plants are localized in organelles. Their functions remain as yet largely unknown. The majority of characterized PPR proteins have been found to function in modulating the expression plastid and mitochondrial genes in plants. Results: Here, a genome-wide identification and comparison of the PPR genes from 5 organisms was performed, including the moss Physcomitrella patens, the lycophyte Selaginella moellendorffii, the eudicot Arabidopsis, and the monocots rice and foxtail millet. It appears that the expansion of this gene family prior to the divergence of the euphyllophytes and the lycophytes in land plants. The duplication and divergence rates of the foxtail millet PPR genes (SiPPRs) showed that the expansion period of this gene family around 400 Mya, and indicated that genome segmental duplication was very likely the primary mechanism underlying the expansion of the PPR gene family in vascular plants. An analysis of a complete set of SiPPR genes/proteins that included classification, chromosomal location, orthologous relationships, duplication analysis, and auxiliary motifs is presented. Expression analysis of the SiPPR genes under stress conditions revealed that the expression of 24 SiPPR genes was responsive to abiotic stress. Subcellular localization analysis of 11 PPR proteins indicated that 5 proteins were localized to chloroplasts, that 4 were localized to mitochondria, and that 2 were localized to the cytoplasm. Conclusions: Our results contribute to a more comprehensive understanding the roles of PPR proteins and will be useful in the prioritization of particular PPR proteins for subsequent functional validation studies in foxtail millet. © 2016 The Author(s).},

abstract={The eukaryotic chaperonin, CCT (Chaperonin Containing TCP1 or TriC-TCP-1 Ring Complex) has been subjected to physical and genetic analyses in S. cerevisiae which can be extrapolated to human CCT (hCCT), owing to its structural and functional similarities with yeast CCT (yCCT). Studies on hCCT and its interactome acquire an additional dimension, as it has been implicated in several disease conditions like neurodegeneration and cancer. We attempt to study its stress response role in general, which will be reflected in the aspects of human diseases and yeast physiology, through computational analysis of the interactome. Towards consolidating and analysing the interactome data, we prepared and compared the unique CCT-interacting protein lists for S. cerevisiae and H. sapiens, performed GO term classification and enrichment studies which provide information on the diversity in CCT interactome, in terms of protein classes in the data set. Enrichment with disease-associated proteins and pathways highlight the medical importance of CCT. Different analyses converge, suggesting the significance of WD-repeat proteins, protein kinases and cytoskeletal proteins in the interactome. The prevalence of proteasomal subunits and ribosomal proteins suggest a possible cross-talk between protein-synthesis, folding and degradation machinery. A network of chaperones and chaperonins that function in combination can also be envisaged from the CCT interactome-Hsp70 interactome analysis. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Pentatricopeptide repeat containing proteins (PPRs) bind to RNA transcripts originating from mitochondria and plastids. There are two classes of PPR proteins. The P class contains tandem P-type motif sequences, and the PLS class contains alternating P, L and S type sequences. In this paper, we describe a novel tool that predicts PPR-RNA interaction; specifically, our method, which we call aPPRove, determines where and how a PLS-class PPR protein will bind to RNA when given a PPR and one or more RNA transcripts by using a combinatorial binding code for site specificity proposed by Barkan et al. Our results demonstrate that aPPRove successfully locates how and where a PPR protein belonging to the PLS class can bind to RNA. For each binding event it outputs the binding site, the amino-acid-nucleotide interaction, and its statistical significance. Furthermore, we show that our method can be used to predict binding events for PLS-class proteins using a known edit site and the statistical significance of aligning the PPR protein to that site. In particular, we use our method to make a conjecture regarding an interaction between CLB19 and the second intronic region of ycf3.

abstract={The identification of a hexanucleotide repeat expansion in a non-coding region of C9orf72 as a major cause of both frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) drastically changed the field of research on both of these conditions. Yet, despite the vast amount of work aimed at elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying the role of this repeat in disease, the exact pathomechanisms are still unclear. A reduction in the expression of the C9orf72 gene is observed in patients, but a gain-of-function model is now preferred. The hexanucleotide repeat expansion forms RNA foci in the central nervous system (CNS) of repeat-positive FTD and ALS patients, and these foci are believed to sequester RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and impair their function in RNA processing. At the same time, the repeat undergoes repeat-associated non-ATG translation to produce dipeptide repeat proteins that also form inclusions in the patient CNS. Studies from cells and flies suggest that these proteins may also be an important factor in the disease. Finally, the hexanucleotide repeat also induces the mislocalization and aggregation of TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) through an as yet unknown mechanism. This review covers the different potential pathogenic factors that have been put forth for C9orf72-repeat-associated FTD and ALS (C9-FTD/ALS), while highlighting some remaining questions. (Figure presented.) A repeat expansion in C9orf72 is a common cause of both frontal temporal dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Although there is a decrease in C9orf72 expression in patients, this repeat is believed to induce disease primarily through an unknown gain-of-function mechanism involving the RNA, repeat-associated non-AUG translation, or both. This review summarizes and discusses current knowledge on C9orf72 repeat-associated pathophysiology.

abstract={A WD40 protein typically contains four or more repeats of ~40 residues ended with the Trp-Asp dipeptide, which folds into β-propellers with four β strands in each repeat. They often function as scaffolds for protein-protein interactions and are involved in numerous fundamental biological processes. Despite their important functional role, the "velcro" closure of WD40 propellers and the diversity of WD40 repeats make their identification a difficult task. Here we develop a new WD40 Repeat Recognition method (WDRR), which uses predicted secondary structure information to generate candidate repeat segments, and further employs a profile-profile alignment to identify the correct WD40 repeats from candidate segments. In particular, we design a novel alignment scoring function that combines dot product and BLOSUM62, thereby achieving a great balance of sensitivity and accuracy. Taking advantage of these strategies, WDRR could effectively reduce the false positive rate and accurately identify more remote homologous WD40 repeats with precise repeat boundaries. We further use WDRR to re-annotate the Pfam families in the β-propeller clan (CL0186) and identify a number of WD40 repeat proteins with high confidence across nine model organisms.

abstract={Over the last decade, numerous studies have demonstrated the fundamental importance of tandem repeat (TR) proteins in many biological processes. A plethora of new repeat structures have also been solved. The recently published RepeatsDB provides information on TR proteins. However, a detailed structural characterization of repetitive elements is largely missing, as repeat unit annotation is manually curated and currently covers only 3 % of the bona fide TR proteins. Repeat Protein Unit Predictor (ReUPred) is a novel method for the fast automatic prediction of repeat units and repeat classification using an extensive Structure Repeat Unit Library (SRUL) derived from RepeatsDB. ReUPred uses an iterative structural search against the SRUL to find repetitive units. On a test set of solenoid proteins, ReUPred is able to correctly detect 92 % of the proteins. Unlike previous methods, it is also able to correctly classify solenoid repeats in 89 % of cases. It also outperforms two recent state-of-the-art methods for the repeat unit identification problem. The accurate prediction of repeat units increases the number of annotated repeat units by an order of magnitude compared to the sequence-based Pfam classification. ReUPred is implemented in Python for Linux and freely available from the URL: http://protein.bio.unipd.it/reupred/. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Wien.},

abstract={Motivation: Developments in biotechnology have enabled the in vitro evolution of binding proteins. The emerging limitations of antibodies in binding protein engineering have led to suggestions for other proteins as alternative binding protein scaffolds. Most of these proteins were selected based on human intuition rather than systematic analysis of the available data. To improve this strategy, we developed a computational framework for finding desirable binding protein scaffolds by utilizing protein structure and sequence information. Results: For each protein, its structure and the sequences of evolutionarily-related proteins were analyzed, and spatially contiguous regions composed of highly variable residues were identified. A large number of proteins have these regions, but leucine rich repeats (LRRs), histidine kinase domains and immunoglobulin domains are predominant among them. The candidates suggested as new binding protein scaffolds include histidine kinase, LRR, titin and pentapeptide repeat protein.

abstract={Objective: To construct the expression vector for proline / arginine-rich end leucine-rich repeat protein (PRELP) shRNA and identify its silencing effect in Saos-2 cells. Methods: Two pairs of interfering sequences were designed according to the mRMA sequences of PRELP, synthesized chemically and inserted into lentivirus vector, with which Saos-2 cells were transfected at various MOIs, and the MOI at which the positive rate of GFP in cells was the highest was screened. Saos-2 cells were transfected with the constructed lentivirus vector at the screened MOI, from which the stably transfected strains were screened with puromycin. The down-regulation efficacy of PRELP in two stably transfected cell strains were verified by Western blot. Results: The lentivirus vector for PRELP shRNA was constructed successfully. When the MOI was 50, the positive rate of GFP in cells reached the maximum. Stably transfected cell strains were obtained by screening with puromycin, in which the expression of PRELP was significantly inhibited. Conclusion: The lentiviral expression vector for PRELP shRNA was constructed successfully, and the Saos-2 cell model with down-regulated expression of PRELP was established, which laid a foundation of study on role of PRELP in osteoarthritis.},

abstract={Clubroot, caused by Plasmodiophora brassicae, is an important disease on Brassica species worldwide. A clubroot resistance gene, Rcr1, with efficacy against pathotype 3 of P. brassicae, was previously mapped to chromosome A03 of B. rapa in pak choy cultivar "Flower Nabana". In the current study, resistance to pathotypes 2,5 and 6 was shown to be associated with Rcr1 region on chromosome A03. Bulked segregant RNA sequencing was performed and short read sequences were assembled into 10 chromosomes of the B. rapa reference genome v1.5. For the resistant (R) bulks, a total of 351.8 million (M) sequences, 30,836.5 million bases (Mb) in length, produced 120-fold coverage of the reference genome. For the susceptible (S) bulks, 322.9 M sequences, 28,216.6 Mb in length, produced 109-fold coverage. In total, 776.2 K single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 122.2 K insertion/deletion (InDels) in R bulks and 762.8 K SNPs and 118.7 K InDels in S bulks were identified; each chromosome had about 87% SNPs and 13% InDels, with 78% monomorphic and 22% polymorphic variants between the R and S bulks. Polymorphic variants on each chromosome were usually below 23%, but made up 34% of the variants on chromosome A03. There were 35 genes annotated in the Rcr1 target region and variants were identified in 21 genes. The numbers of poly variants differed significantly among the genes. Four out of them encode Toll-Interleukin-1 receptor/nucleotide-binding site/leucine-rich-repeat proteins; Bra019409 and Bra019410 harbored the higher numbers of polymorphic variants, which indicates that they are more likely candidates of Rcr1. Fourteen SNP markers in the target region were genotyped using the Kompetitive Allele Specific PCR method and were confirmed to associate with Rcr1. Selected SNP markers were analyzed with 26 recombinants obtained from a segregating population consisting of 1587 plants, indicating that they were completely linked to Rcr1. Nine SNP markers were used for marker-assisted introgression of Rcr1 into B. napus canola from B. rapa, with 100% accuracy in this study. © 2016 Yu et al.

abstract={Ribosomal RNA processing is essential for plastid ribosome biogenesis, but is still poorly understood in higher plants. Here, we show that SUPPRESSOR OF THYLAKOID FORMATION1 (SOT1), a plastid-localized pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) protein with a small MutS-related domain, is required for maturation of the 23S-4.5S rRNA dicistron. Loss of SOT1 function leads to slower chloroplast development, suppression of leaf variegation, and abnormal 23S and 4.5S processing. Predictions based on the PPR motif sequences identified the 5' end of the 23S-4.5S rRNA dicistronic precursor as a putative SOT1 binding site. This was confirmed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay, and by loss of the abundant small RNA 'footprint' associated with this site in sot1 mutants. We found that more than half of the 23S-4.5S rRNA dicistrons in sot1 mutants contain eroded and/or unprocessed 5' and 3' ends, and that the endonucleolytic cleavage product normally released from the 5' end of the precursor is absent in a sot1 null mutant. We postulate that SOT1 binding protects the 5' extremity of the 23S-4.5S rRNA dicistron from exonucleolytic attack, and favours formation of the RNA structure that allows endonucleolytic processing of its 5' and 3' ends. © 2016 The Authors The Plant Journal © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract={Staphylococcus epidermidis causes nosocomial infections by colonizing and forming biofilms on indwelling medical devices. This process involves specific interactions between cell wall-anchored (CWA) proteins and host proteins adsorbed onto the biomaterial. Here, we have explored the molecular forces by which the S.epidermidisCWA protein serine-aspartate repeat protein F (SdrF) binds to type I collagen, by means of advanced atomic force microscopy (AFM) techniques. Using single-cell force spectroscopy, we found that SdrF mediates bacterial adhesion to collagen-coated substrates through both weak and strong bonds. Single-molecule force spectroscopy demonstrated that these bonds involve the A and B regions of SdrF, thus revealing that the protein is capable of dual ligand-binding activity. Both weak and strong bonds showed high dissociation rates, indicating they are much less stable than those formed by the well-characterized 'dock, lock and latch' mechanism. Collectively, our results show that CWA proteins can bind to ligands by novel mechanisms. We anticipate that AFM will greatly contribute to the identification of novel binding partners and binding mechanisms in staphylococcal CWA proteins. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

In addition, there were 431 significantly differentially regulated proteins having at least two biological samples. This subject found some of the differential proteins, such as prolyl 4-hydroxylase subunit alpha-1, prolyl 4-hydroxylase subunit alpha-2, and calponin-2, immunoglobulin superfamily containing leucine-rich repeat protein, and prolyl 3-hydroxylase1, which were few studies about them in ESCC.

abstract={The pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins form one of the largest protein families in land plants. They are characterised by tandem 30-40 amino acid motifs that form an extended binding surface capable of sequence-specific recognition of RNA strands. Almost all of them are post-translationally targeted to plastids and mitochondria, where they play important roles in post-transcriptional processes including splicing, RNA editing and the initiation of translation. A code describing how PPR proteins recognise their RNA targets promises to accelerate research on these proteins, but making use of this code requires accurate definition and annotation of all of the various nucleotide-binding motifs in each protein. We have used a structural modelling approach to define 10 different variants of the PPR motif found in plant proteins, in addition to the putative deaminase motif that is found at the C-terminus of many RNA-editing factors. We show that the super-helical RNA-binding surface of RNA-editing factors is potentially longer than previously recognised. We used the redefined motifs to develop accurate and consistent annotations of PPR sequences from 109 genomes. We report a high error rate in PPR gene models in many public plant proteomes, due to gene fusions and insertions of spurious introns. These consistently annotated datasets across a wide range of species are valuable resources for future comparative genomics studies, and an essential pre-requisite for accurate large-scale computational predictions of PPR targets. We have created a web portal (http://www.plantppr.com) that provides open access to these resources for the community. Significance Statement Accurate prediction of the RNA targets of pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins requires accurate annotation of their RNA-binding motifs. Here we used structural modelling to define 10 different variants of PPR motifs in plant proteins and used these redefined motifs to develop improved annotations of PPRs from 109 genomes. These consistently annotated datasets are valuable resources for comparative genomics studies and for large-scale prediction of PPR function. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract={Phosphoprotein phosphatase 1 (PPP1) catalytic subunit gamma 2 (PPP1CC2), a PPP1 isoform, is largely restricted to testicular germ cells and spermatozoa. The key to understanding PPP1 regulation in male germ cells lies in the identification and characterisation of its interacting partners. This study was undertaken to determine the expression patterns of the several ankyrin repeat protein variant 2 (SARP2), a PPP1-interacting protein, in testis and spermatozoa. SARP2 was found to be highly expressed in testis and spermatozoa, and its interaction with human spermatozoa endogenous PPP1CC2 was confirmed by immunoprecipitation. Expression analysis by RT-qPCR revealed that SARP2 and PPP1CC2 mRNA levels were significantly higher in the spermatocyte fraction. However, microscopy revealed that SARP2 protein was only present in the nucleus of elongating and mature spermatids and in spermatozoa. In spermatozoa, SARP2 was prominently expressed in the connecting piece and flagellum, as well as, to a lesser extent, in the acrosome. A yeast two-hybrid approach was used to detect SARP2-interacting proteins and a relevant interaction with a novel sperm-associated antigen 9 (SPAG9) variant, a testis and spermatozoa-specific c-Jun N-terminal kinase-binding protein, was validated in human spermatozoa. Given the expression pattern of SARP2 and its association with PPP1CC2 and SPAG9, it may play a role in spermiogenesis and sperm function, namely in sperm motility and the acrosome reaction. © CSIRO 2016.},

abstract={Mitochondrial translation involves a complex interplay of ancient bacteria-like features and host-derived functionalities. Although the basic components of the mitochondrial translation apparatus have been recognized, very few protein factors aiding in recruiting ribosomes on mitochondria-encoded messenger RNA (mRNAs) have been identified in higher plants. In this study, we describe the identification of the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) MITOCHONDRIAL TRANSLATION FACTOR1 (MTL1) protein, a new member of the Pentatricopeptide Repeat family, and show that it is essential for the translation of the mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase subunit7 (nad7) mRNA. We demonstrate that mtl1 mutant plants fail to accumulate the Nad7 protein, even though the nad7 mature mRNA is produced and bears the same 59 and 39 extremities as in wild-type plants. We next observed that polysome association of nad7 mature mRNA is specifically disrupted in mtl1 mutants, indicating that the absence of Nad7 results from a lack of translation of nad7 mRNA. These findings illustrate that mitochondrial translation requires the intervention of gene-specific nucleus-encoded PPR trans-factors and that their action does not necessarily involve the 59 processing of their target mRNA, as observed previously. Interestingly, a partial decrease in nad7 intron 2 splicing was also detected in mtl1 mutants, suggesting that MTL1 is also involved in group II intron splicing. However, this second function appears to be less essential for nad7 expression than its role in translation. MTL1 will be instrumental to understand the multifunctionality of PPR proteins and the mechanisms governing mRNA translation and intron splicing in plant mitochondria. © 2016 American Society of Plant Biologists.

abstract={Background: The analysis of correlations of amino acid occurrences in globular domains has led to the development of statistical tools that can identify native contacts - portions of the chains that come to close distance in folded structural ensembles. Here we introduce a direct coupling analysis for repeat proteins - natural systems for which the identification of folding domains remains challenging. Results: We show that the inherent translational symmetry of repeat protein sequences introduces a strong bias in the pair correlations at precisely the length scale of the repeat-unit. Equalizing for this bias in an objective way reveals true co-evolutionary signals from which local native contacts can be identified. Importantly, parameter values obtained for all other interactions are not significantly affected by the equalization. We quantify the robustness of the procedure and assign confidence levels to the interactions, identifying the minimum number of sequences needed to extract evolutionary information in several repeat protein families. Conclusions: The overall procedure can be used to reconstruct the interactions at distances larger than repeat-pairs, identifying the characteristics of the strongest couplings in each family, and can be applied to any system that appears translationally symmetric. © 2015 Espada et al.},

abstract={Background: Transgenerational epigenetics (TGE) are currently considered important in disease, but the mechanisms involved are not yet fully understood. TGE abnormalities expected to cause disease are likely to be initiated during development and to be mediated by aberrant gene expression associated with aberrant promoter methylation that is heritable between generations. However, because methylation is removed and then re-established during development, it is not easy to identify promoter methylation abnormalities by comparing normal lineages with those expected to exhibit TGE abnormalities. Methods: This study applied the recently proposed principal component analysis (PCA)-based unsupervised feature extraction to previously reported and publically available gene expression/promoter methylation profiles of rat primordial germ cells, between E13 and E16 of the F3 generation vinclozolin lineage that are expected to exhibit TGE abnormalities, to identify multiple genes that exhibited aberrant gene expression/promoter methylation during development. Results: The biological feasibility of the identified genes were tested via enrichment analyses of various biological concepts including pathway analysis, gene ontology terms and protein-protein interactions. All validations suggested superiority of the proposed method over three conventional and popular supervised methods that employed t test, limma and significance analysis of microarrays, respectively. The identified genes were globally related to tumors, the prostate, kidney, testis and the immune system and were previously reported to be related to various diseases caused by TGE. Conclusions: Among the genes reported by PCA-based unsupervised feature extraction, we propose that chemokine signaling pathways and leucine rich repeat proteins are key factors that initiate transgenerational epigenetic-mediated diseases, because multiple genes included in these two categories were identified in this study. © 2015 Taguchi et al.},

abstract={Stellera chamaejasme L. is a well-recognized traditional medicine in China and can synthesizes various secondary metabolites including a group of flavonoids. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying flavonoid biosynthesis. In this study, large-scale RNA sequencing on flower of S. chamaejasme produced a de novo transcriptome consisting of 32,216 unigenes with a N50 length of 1745 bp. Among all unigenes, 21,355 unigenes were identified as putative homologs of annotated sequences in the public protein databases. Further functional classification revealed that the active genes in flower are predominately involved in metabolic process and biosynthesis of secondary metabolite pathways. A total of 19 candidate genes encoding 11 structural enzymes involved in flavonoid biosynthesis were identified in the unigene dataset by targeted searches of their annotations. In addition, a number of regulatory genes including MYB, basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH), and WD40 repeat proteins were discovered based on transcriptome dataset. Therefore, this study presents the first survey of transcriptome on the flower of S. chamaejasme to discover the major candidate genes involved in flavonoid biosynthesis pathway. These results will promote an understanding of the genetic mechanism of flavonoid biosynthesis in S. chamaejasme. At the same time, this transcriptome dataset can serve as an important public information platform for gene expression, genomic and functional genomic studies in this species. © 2015 The Authors.

abstract={Tandem repeats (TR) in proteins are common in nature and have several unique functions. They come in various forms that are frequently difficult to recognize from a sequence. A previously proposed structural classification has been recently implemented in the RepeatsDB database. This defines five main classes, mainly based on repeat unit length, with subclasses representing specific folds. Sequence-based classifications, such as Pfam, provide an alternative classification based on evolutionarily conserved repeat families. Here, we discuss a detailed comparison between the structural classes in RepeatsDB and the corresponding Pfam repeat families and clans. Most instances are found to map one-to-one between structure and sequence. Some notable exceptions such as leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) and α-solenoids are discussed. © 2015 Authors; published by Portland Press Limited.},

abstract={BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Periodontitis is the most prevalent inflammatory disease worldwide and is caused by a dysbiotic subgingival biofilm. Here we used metatranscriptomics to determine the functional shift from health to periodontitis, the response of individual species to dysbiosis and to discover biomarkers. METHODS: Sixteen individuals were studied, from which six were diagnosed with chronic periodontitis. Illumina sequencing of the total messenger RNA (mRNA) yielded - 42 million reads per sample. A total of 324 human oral taxon phylotypes and 366,055 open reading frames from the HOMD database reference genomes were detected. RESULTS: The transcriptionally active community shifted from Bacilli and Actinobacteria in health to Bacteroidia, Deltaproteobacteria, Spirochaetes and Synergistetes in periodontitis. Clusters of orthologous groups (COGs) related to carbohydrate transport and catabolism dominated in health, whereas protein degradation and amino acid catabolism dominated in disease. The LEfSe, random forest and support vector machine methods were applied to the 2,000 most highly expressed genes and discovered the three best functional biomarkers, namely haem binding protein HmuY from Porphyromonas gingivalis, flagellar filament core protein FlaB3 from Treponema denticola, and repeat protein of unknown function from Filifactor alocis. They predicted the diagnosis correctly for 14 from 16 individuals, and when applied to an independent study misclassified one out of six subjects only. Prevotella nigrescens shifted from commensalism to virulence by upregulating the expression of metalloproteases and the haem transporter. Expression of genes for the synthesis of the cytotoxic short-chain fatty acid butyrate was observed by Fusobacterium nucleatum under all conditions. Four additional species contributed to butyrate synthesis in periodontitis and they used an additional pathway. CONCLUSION: Gene biomarkers of periodontitis are highly predictive. The pro-inflammatory role of F. nucelatum is not related to butyrate synthesis. © 2015 Nanyang Technological University/Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

abstract={Background: Monolayer cultures of immortalised cell lines are a popular screening tool for novel anti-cancer therapeutics, but these methods can be a poor surrogate for disease states, and there is a need for drug screening platforms which are more predictive of clinical outcome. In this study, we describe a phenotypic antibody screen using three-dimensional cultures of primary cells, and image-based multi-parametric profiling in PC-3 cells, to identify anti-cancer biologics against new therapeutic targets. Methods: ScFv Antibodies and designed ankyrin repeat proteins (DARPins) were isolated using phage display selections against primary non-small cell lung carcinoma cells. The selected molecules were screened for anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic activity against primary cells grown in three-dimensional culture, and in an ultra-high content screen on a 3-D cultured cell line using multi-parametric profiling to detect treatment-induced phenotypic changes. The targets of molecules of interest were identified using a cell-surface membrane protein array. An anti-CUB domain containing protein 1 (CDCP1) antibody was tested for tumour growth inhibition in a patient-derived xenograft model, generated from a stage-IV non-small cell lung carcinoma, with and without cisplatin. Results: Two primary non-small cell lung carcinoma cell models were established for antibody isolation and primary screening in anti-proliferative and apoptosis assays. These assays identified multiple antibodies demonstrating activity in specific culture formats. A subset of the DARPins was profiled in an ultra-high content multi-parametric screen, where 300 morphological features were measured per sample. Machine learning was used to select features to classify treatment responses, then antibodies were characterised based on the phenotypes that they induced. This method co-classified several DARPins that targeted CDCP1 into two sets with different phenotypes. Finally, an anti-CDCP1 antibody significantly enhanced the efficacy of cisplatin in a patient-derived NSCLC xenograft model. Conclusions: Phenotypic profiling using complex 3-D cell cultures steers hit selection towards more relevant in vivo phenotypes, and may shed light on subtle mechanistic variations in drug candidates, enabling data-driven decisions for oncology target validation. CDCP1 was identified as a potential target for cisplatin combination therapy. © 2015 Sandercock et al.},

abstract={Background: The analysis of correlations of amino acid occurrences in globular domains has led to the development of statistical tools that can identify native contacts - portions of the chains that come to close distance in folded structural ensembles. Here we introduce a direct coupling analysis for repeat proteins - natural systems for which the identification of folding domains remains challenging. Results: We show that the inherent translational symmetry of repeat protein sequences introduces a strong bias in the pair correlations at precisely the length scale of the repeat-unit. Equalizing for this bias in an objective way reveals true co-evolutionary signals from which local native contacts can be identified. Importantly, parameter values obtained for all other interactions are not significantly affected by the equalization. We quantify the robustness of the procedure and assign confidence levels to the interactions, identifying the minimum number of sequences needed to extract evolutionary information in several repeat protein families. Conclusions: The overall procedure can be used to reconstruct the interactions at distances larger than repeat-pairs, identifying the characteristics of the strongest couplings in each family, and can be applied to any system that appears translationally symmetric. © 2015 Espada et al.},

abstract={BACKGROUND: RACK1 is strongly associated with the occurrence and development of oral squamous cell carcinoma. However, the occurrence and development of tumor do not depend on a gene or protein, but a long-term complex process of a network structure of multiple genes and multiple molecules, multi-step, multi-stage joint action. Synergism between tumor genes promotes the formation and development of tumor cells. Therefore, we cannot limit on a single gene or protein to discover the action mechanism of oral squamous cell carcinoma, but should pay attention on signaling network path related to differential protein or gene, investigate the alterations in related protein or gene expression in the whole signaling pathway, and analyze the action mechanism of the interaction of these molecules. OBJECTIVE: To screen differential genes related to oral squamous cell carcinoma, construct an interaction network through bioinformatics using STRING database, and provide clues for future tests. METHODS: In accordance with our previous classic proteomics results and microarray results of oral squamous cell carcinoma, genes with consistent expression and big differences were selected as differential genes. The differential genes were inputted into the database of STRING to find the possible relationship among the protein subunits and to construct network structure of their interaction. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The 19 differential proteins of oral squamous cell carcinoma construct a complicated net work, and the differential proteins interact through these networks. GNB2L1-encoded RACK1 is a node protein and interacts with other differential proteins via WD40 repeated protein (number COG2319) and β-G protein subunit (number KOG0279). WD40 repeated protein (number COG2319) interacts with 5 differential proteins directly and constructs 10 interacting pathways. β-G protein subunit (number KOG0279) interacts with 8 differential proteins directly, which has 11 interacting pathways. We make a network structure picture based on the interaction of these 19 differential genes by the analysis of the STRING database. The results show that the two subunits of RACK1 protein have direct interaction with 8 differential proteins and have 18 interaction pathways on the picture. As a result, RACK1 is the core protein of the network, suggesting RACK1 is the key node protein in oral squamous cell carcinoma. © 2015, Journal of Clinical Rehabilitative Tissue Engineering Research.

abstract={Background: Citrus represents a crop of global importance both in economic impact and significance to nutrition. Citrus production worldwide is threatened by the disease Huanglongbing (HLB), caused by the phloem-limited pathogen Candidatus Liberibacter spp.. As a source of stable HLB-resistance has yet to be identified, there is considerable interest in characterization of novel disease-associated citrus genes. Results: A gene family of Small Cyclic Amphipathic Peptides (SCAmpPs) in citrus is described. The citrus genomes contain 100-150 SCAmpPs genes, approximately 50 of which are represented in the citrus EST database. These genes encode small ~50 residue precursor proteins that are post-translationally processed, releasing 5-10 residue cyclic peptides. The structures of the SCAmpPs genes are highly conserved, with the small coding domains interrupted by a single intron and relatively extended untranslated regions. Some family members are very highly transcribed in specific citrus tissues, as determined by representation in tissue-specific cDNA libraries. Comparison of the ESTs of related SCAmpPs revealed an unexpected evolutionary profile, consistent with targeted mutagenesis of the predicted cyclic peptide domain. The SCAmpPs genes are displayed in clusters on the citrus chromosomes, with apparent association with receptor leucine-rich repeat protein arrays. This study focused on three SCAmpPs family members with high constitutive expression in citrus phloem. Unexpectedly high sequence conservation was observed in the promoter region of two phloem-expressed SCAmpPs that encode very distinct predicted cyclic products. The processed cyclic product of one of these phloem SCAmpPs was characterized by LC-MS-MS analysis of phloem tissue, revealing properties consistent with a K+ ionophore. Conclusions: The SCAmpPs amino acid composition, protein structure, expression patterns, evolutionary profile and chromosomal distribution are consistent with designation as ribosomally synthesized defense-related peptides. © Belknap et al.; licensee BioMed Central.},

abstract={Small proline-rich repeat protein 1A (SPRR1A) is a marker for terminal squamous cell differentiation. Previous studies showed that SPRR1A expression increases in squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, but decreases in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. This study focuses on the expression of SPRR1A protein in breast cancers (BCs) in China. A total of 111 patients with histologically confirmed BC, who underwent radical surgery between January 2006 and September 2007 in China Medical University, were enrolled. The relationship between SPRR1A expression and clinicopathological factors as well as BC prognoses was also determined. Overall, SPRR1A expression was detected in more than half of the BC specimens by immunohistochemistry (56/111, 53.8 %), but there was no significant difference between age groups (≥50 vs. <50 years) in terms of SPRR1A expression (P = 0.915), as well as no differences between SPRR1A expression and the clinical stage (0–I vs. II–III) or nodal status (P = 0.234 and 0.632, respectively). Moreover, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 overexpression was not correlated with SPRR1A expression, whereas Ki67 was associated with SPRR1A expression (P = 0.155 and 0.028, respectively). Interestingly, SPRR1A expression was significantly associated with progesterone receptor-positive (P = 0.010) rather than estrogen receptor-positive (0.778) BCs. The 5-year survival rate in patients did not differ with the presence or absence of SPRR1A expression (P = 0.753), whereas the combination of SPRR1A expression, progesterone receptor status, and menopausal status allowed identification of a subgroup of BC patients with a good long-term prognosis. Thus, the SPRR1A status might play an important role in the prognosis of postmenopausal breast carcinoma patients, especially that of progesterone receptor-positive subgroups. © 2014, International Society of Oncology and BioMarkers (ISOBM).},

abstract={Repeat proteins have become increasingly important due to their capability to bind to almost any proteins and the potential as alternative therapy to monoclonal antibodies. In the past decade repeat proteins have been designed to mediate specific protein-protein interactions. The tetratricopeptide and ankyrin repeat proteins are two classes of helical repeat proteins that form different binding pockets to accommodate various partners. It is important to understand the factors that define folding and stability of repeat proteins in order to prioritize the most stable designed repeat proteins to further explore their potential binding affinities. Here we developed distance-dependant statistical potentials using two classes of alpha-helical repeat proteins, tetratricopeptide and ankyrin repeat proteins respectively, and evaluated their efficiency in predicting the stability of repeat proteins. We demonstrated that the repeat-specific statistical potentials based on these two classes of repeat proteins showed paramount accuracy compared with non-specific statistical potentials in: 1) discriminate correct vs. incorrect models 2) rank the stability of designed repeat proteins. In particular, the statistical scores correlate closely with the equilibrium unfolding free energies of repeat proteins and therefore would serve as a novel tool in quickly prioritizing the designed repeat proteins with high stability.

abstract={WD40-repeat proteins, as one of the largest protein families, often serve as platforms to assemble functional complexes through the hotspot residues on their domain surfaces, and thus play vital roles in many biological processes.

Systematic identification of WD40-repeat proteins, including prediction of their secondary structures, tertiary structures and potential hotspot residues responsible for protein-protein interactions, may constitute a valuable resource upon this request. To achieve this goal, we developed a specialized database WDSPdb (http://wu. scbb.pkusz.edu.cn/wdsp/) to provide these details of WD40-repeat proteins based on our recently published method WDSP. The WDSPdb contains 63 211 WD40-repeat proteins identified from 3383 species, including most well-known model organisms.

abstract={In biomolecules, bifurcated H-bonds typically involve the interaction of two donor protons with the two lone pairs of oxygen. Here, we present direct NMR evidence for a bifurcated H-bonding arrangement involving nitrogen as the acceptor atom. Specifically, the H-bond network comprises the Nδ1 atom of histidine and both the backbone N-H and side-chain Oγ-H of threonine within the conserved TXXH motif of ankyrin repeat (AR) proteins. Identification of the H-bonding partners is achieved via solution NMR H-bond scalar coupling (HBC) and H/D isotope shift experiments. Quantitative determination of 2hJ<inf>NN</inf> HBCs supports that Thr N-H⋯Nδ1 His H-bonds within internal repeats are stronger (∼4 Hz) than in the solvent exposed C-terminal AR (∼2 Hz). In agreement, pK<inf>a</inf> values for the buried histidines bridging internal ARs are several units lower than those of the C-terminus. Quantum chemical calculations show that the relevant 2hJ and 1hJ couplings are dominated by the Fermi contact interaction. Finally, a Thr-to-Val replacement, which eliminates the Thr Oγ-H⋯ Nδ1 His H-bond and decreases protein stability, results in a 25% increase in 2hJ<inf>NN</inf>, attributed to optimization of the Val N-H⋯Nδ1 His H-bond. Overall, the results provide new insights into the H-bonding properties of histidine, a refined structural rationalization for the folding cooperativity of AR proteins, and a challenging benchmark for the calculation of HBCs. © 2015 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Tandem repeat structures are widely distributed among all classes of proteins. Various basic structural units of repetitive nature possess functional diversity and reflect important influences on biological responses for different organisms. One of the most common types of protein repeat structure is the α-solenoid tandem repeat class which possesses low sequence similarity between any two repeat units within a structure. Therefore, a successful segmentation system for identifying each repeat unit cannot be achieved mainly based on sequence comparison approaches. For a comprehensive analysis on fundamental repeat unit segmentation, subclass identification, and functional annotation on such repeat structures, we have developed an automatic segmentation system according to geometrical coordinates and physical characteristics. Dihedral angles of Psi and Alpha were applied to define the range of candidate α helix elements, and the included angle between the vectors formulated by previously defined neighboring α helix elements was analyzed for constructing a fundamental repeat unit. To evaluate the performance of our developed prediction system, we employed 923 protein structures collected in the RepeatsDB database and clustered as α-solenoid repeat class. The testing result has shown that our proposed system could achieve a recall rate of 92.39% and a precision rate of 93.52%, respectively. © 2015 The authors and IOS Press. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Viroids are small, covalently closed, circular non-coding RNA pathogens of flowering plants. It is proposed that the symptoms of viroid pathogenesis result from a direct interaction between the viroid genomic RNA and unknown host plant factors. Using a comparative genomic approach we took advantage of the detailed annotation of the Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) genome to identify sequence homologies between putative viroid-derived small RNAs (vd-sRNAs) and coding regions in the plant genome. A pool of sequence homologies among 29 species of the Pospiviroidae family and the Arabidopsis genome was analyzed. Using this strategy we identified putative host gene targets that may be involved in symptom expression in viroid-infected plants. In this communication, we report the in silico prediction and the experimental validation of pospiviroid-derived sRNAs conserved in the lower strand of the pathogenicity domain of seven viroid species infecting tomato; those vd-sRNAs targeted for cleavage the host mRNA encoding a conserved tomato WD40-repeat protein (SolWD40-repeat; SGN_U563134). Analysis of SolWD40-repeat expression indicated that this gene is down-regulated in tomato plants infected with tomato planta macho viroid (TPMVd). Furthermore, 5' RLM-RACE revealed that the SolWD40-repeat mRNA is cleaved at the predicted target site showing complementarity to a corresponding TPMVd-sRNA identified in silico. Our approach proved to be useful for the identification of natural host genes containing sequence homologies with segments of the Pospiviroidae genome. Using this strategy we identified a functionally conserved gene in Arabidopsis and tomato, whose expression was modified during viroid infection in the host genome; regulation of this gene expression could be guided by vd-sRNA:mRNA complementarity, suggesting that the comparison of the Arabidopsis genome to viroid sequences could lead to the identification of unexpected interactions between viroid RNAs and their host. © 2015.},

abstract={The ankyrin repeats (ANKs) of the methyltransferases G9a and GLP bind methyllysine (meK) in a surface aromatic cage. Binding the methylation product with the very same polypeptide that generates it seems essential for some G9a/GLP functions, but it is dispensable for others. We first consider the structure of ANKs, particularly to illustrate that different binding modes can exist on the same scaffold and to facilitate the search for other meK-binding ANKs. Huntingtin (HTT)-interacting protein-14 (HIP14) was predicted based on conservation of key cage residues to also have a surface aromatic cage. This prediction has been confirmed, but the HIP14-binding partner remains elusive. Hip14 interacts with HTT through its ANKs. Htt directly binds a methyltransferase and manifests improper patterns of post-translational modification in Huntington’s disease. We have extended the search for other ANKs with meK-binding potential, and we present our results. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

abstract={The Arabidopsis thylakoid membrane bimodular oxidoreductase, AtVKOR, could catalyze disulfide bond formation, and its direct functional domain (thioredoxin-like domain) is located in the thylakoid lumen according to the topological structure. Many proteins have one or several disulfide bonds in the thylakoid lumen, including photosynthetic chain components. A yeast two-hybrid assay was used to identify potential targets for the AtVKOR, and a Trx-like domain was constructed into a BD vector as bait. Twenty-two thylakoid lumenal proteins with disulfides were selected. The cDNAs encoding these proteins were constructed into an AD vector. Eight proteins were identified from the hybrid results to interact with AtVKOR, including HCF164, cytochrome c6A, violaxanthin deepoxidase, embryo sac development arrest 3 protein (EDA3), two members pentapeptide repeat proteins (TL17 and TL20.3), and two FK-506 binding proteins (FKBP13 and FKBP20-2). The BIACORE system was used to demonstrate that the recombinant HCF164 and Trx-like domain of AtVKOR could interact directly in vitro. The KD value for binding HCF164 to AtVKOR was calculated as 2.5×10-6 M. These results suggest that AtVKOR can interact with partial thylakoid lumenal proteins and indicates AtVKOR plays an important role in regulating the thylakoid lumen redox. © 2015 Bentham Science Publishers.},

abstract={Background: Tandem repetition of structural motifs in proteins is frequently observed across all forms of life. Topology of repeating unit and its frequency of occurrence are associated to a wide range of structural and functional roles in diverse proteins, and defects in repeat proteins have been associated with a number of diseases. It is thus desirable to accurately identify specific repeat type and its copy number. Weak evolutionary constraints on repeat units and insertions/deletions between them make their identification difficult at the sequence level and structure based approaches are desired. The proposed graph spectral approach is based on protein structure represented as a graph for detecting one of the most frequently observed structural repeats, Ankyrin repeat. Results: It has been shown in a large number of studies that 3-dimensional topology of a protein structure is well captured by a graph, making it possible to analyze a complex protein structure as a mathematical entity. In this study we show that eigen spectra profile of a protein structure graph exhibits a unique repetitive profile for contiguous repeating units enabling the detection of the repeat region and the repeat type. The proposed approach uses a non-redundant set of 58 Ankyrin proteins to define rules for the detection of Ankyrin repeat motifs. It is evaluated on a set of 370 proteins comprising 125 known Ankyrin proteins and remaining non-solenoid proteins and the prediction compared with UniProt annotation, sequence-based approach, RADAR, and structure-based approach, ConSole. To show the efficacy of the approach, we analyzed the complete PDB structural database and identified 641 previously unrecognized Ankyrin repeat proteins. We observe a unique eigen spectra profile for different repeat types and show that the method can be easily extended to detect other repeat types. It is implemented as a web server, AnkPred. It is freely available at. Conclusions: AnkPred provides an elegant and computationally efficient graph-based approach for detecting Ankyrin structural repeats in proteins. By analyzing the eigen spectra of the protein structure graph and secondary structure information, characteristic features of a known repeat family are identified. This method is especially useful in correctly identifying new members of a repeat family. © 2014 Chakrabarty and Parekh; licensee BioMed Central.},

abstract={Protein recovery is crucial for shotgun metaproteomics to study the in situ functionality of microbial populations from complex biofilms but still poorly addressed by far. To fill this knowledge gap, we systematically evaluated the sample preparation with extraction buffers comprising four detergents for the metaproteomics analysis of a terephthalate-degrading methanogenic biofilm using an on-line two-dimensional liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (2D-LC-MS/MS) system. Totally, 1018 non-repeated proteins were identified with the four treatments. On the whole, each treatment could recover the biofilm proteins with specific distributions of molecular weight, hydrophobicity, and isoelectric point. The extraction buffers containing zwitterionic and anionic detergents were found to harvest the proteins with better efficiency and quality, allowing identification up to 76.2% of total identified proteins with the LC-MS/MS analysis. According to the annotation with a relevant metagenomic database, we further observed different taxonomic profiles of bacterial and archaeal members and discriminable patterns of the functional expression among the extraction buffers used. Overall, the finding of the present study provides first insight to the effect of the detergents on the characteristics of extractable proteins from biofilm and the developed protocol combined with nano 2D-LC/MS/MS analysis can improve the metaproteomics studies on microbial functionality of biofilms in the wastewater treatment systems. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Ankrd1/CARP, Ankrd2/Arpp, and Ankrd23/DARP belong to a family of stress inducible ankyrin repeat proteins expressed in striated muscle (MARPs). The MARPs are homologous in structure and localized in the nucleus where they negatively regulate gene expression as well as in the sarcomeric I-band, where they are thought to be involved in mechanosensing. Together with their strong induction during cardiac disease and the identification of causative Ankrd1 gene mutations in cardiomyopathy patients, this suggests their important roles in cardiac development, function, and disease. To determine the functional role of MARPs in vivo, we studied knockout (KO) mice of each of the three family members. Single KO mice were viable and had no apparent cardiac phenotype. We therefore hypothesized that the three highly homologous MARP proteins may have redundant functions in the heart and studied double and triple MARP KO mice. Unexpectedly, MARP triple KO mice were viable and had normal cardiac function both at basal levels and in response to mechanical pressure overload induced by transverse aortic constriction as assessed by echocardiography and hemodynamic studies. Thus, CARP, Ankrd2, and DARP are not essential for normal cardiac development and function at basal conditions and in response to mechanical pressure overload. © 2014 Bang et al.},

abstract={In Arabidopsis thaliana, proanthocyanidins (PAs) accumulate in the innermost cell layer of the seed coat (i.e. endothelium, chalaza and micropyle). The expression of the biosynthetic genes involved relies on the transcriptional activity of R2R3-MYB and basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins which form ternary complexes ('MBW') with TRANSPARENT TESTA GLABRA1 (TTG1) (WD repeat protein). The identification of the direct targets and the determination of the nature and spatio-temporal activity of these MBW complexes are essential steps towards a comprehensive understanding of the transcriptional mechanisms that control flavonoid biosynthesis. In this study, various molecular, genetic and biochemical approaches were used. Here, we have demonstrated that, of the 12 studied genes of the pathway, only dihydroflavonol-4-reductase (DFR), leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase (LDOX), BANYULS (BAN), TRANSPARENT TESTA 19 (TT19), TT12 and H+-ATPase isoform 10 (AHA10) are direct targets of the MBW complexes. Interestingly, although the TT2-TT8-TTG1 complex plays the major role in developing seeds, three additional MBW complexes (i.e. MYB5-TT8-TTG1, TT2-EGL3-TTG1 and TT2-GL3-TTG1) were also shown to be involved, in a tissue-specific manner. Finally, a minimal promoter was identified for each of the target genes of the MBW complexes. Altogether, by answering fundamental questions and by demonstrating or invalidating previously made hypotheses, this study provides a new and comprehensive view of the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms controlling PA and anthocyanin biosynthesis in Arabidopsis. © 2013 New Phytologist Trust.},

abstract={The aim of the present study was to identify key genes associated with atopic dermatitis (AD) using microarray data and bioinformatic analyses. The dataset GSE6012, downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, contains gene expression data from 10 AD skin samples and 10 healthy skin samples. Following data preprocessing, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using the limma package of the R project. Interaction networks were constructed comprising DEGs that showed a degree of node of >3, >5 and >10, using the Osprey software. Functional enrichment and pathway enrichment analysis of the network comprising all DEGs and of the network comprising DEGs with a high degree of node, were performed with the DAVID and WebGestalt toolkits, respectively. A total of 337 DEGs were identified. The functional enrichment analysis revealed that the list of DEGs was significantly enriched for proteins related to epidermis development (P=2.95E-07), including loricrin (LOR), keratin 17 (KRT17), small proline-rich repeat proteins (SPRRs) and involucrin (IVL). The chemokine signaling pathway was the most significantly enriched pathway (P=0.0490978) in the network of all DEGs and in the network consisting of high degree-node DEGs (>10), which comprised the genes coding for chemokine receptor 7 (CCR7), chemokine ligand (CCL19), signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1), and phosphoinositide-3-kinase regulatory subunit 1 (PIK3R1). In conclusion, the list of AD-associated proteins identified in this study, including LOR, KRT17, SPRRs, IVL, CCR7, CCL19, PIK3R1 and STAT1 may prove useful for the development of methods to treat AD. From these proteins, PIK3R1 and KRT17 are novel and promising targets for AD therapy.},

abstract={Mitochondria are called the powerhouses of the cell. To better understand the role of mitochondria in maintaining and regulating metabolism in storage tissues, highly purified mitochondria were isolated from dormant potato tubers (Solanum tuberosum 'Folva') and their proteome investigated. Proteins were resolved by one-dimensional gel electrophoresis, and tryptic peptides were extracted from gel slices and analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry using an Orbitrap XL. Using four different search programs, a total of 1,060 nonredundant proteins were identified in a quantitative manner using normalized spectral counts including as many as 5-fold more "extreme" proteins (low mass, high isoelectric point, hydrophobic) than previous mitochondrial proteome studies. We estimate that this compendium of proteins represents a high coverage of the potato tuber mitochondrial proteome (possibly as high as 85%). The dynamic range of protein expression spanned 1,800-fold and included nearly all components of the electron transport chain, tricarboxylic acid cycle, and protein import apparatus. Additionally, we identified 71 pentatricopeptide repeat proteins, 29 membrane carriers/transporters, a number of new proteins involved in coenzyme biosynthesis and iron metabolism, the pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, and a type 2C protein phosphatase that may catalyze the dephosphorylation of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. Systematic analysis of prominent posttranslational modifications revealed that more than 50% of the identified proteins harbor at least one modification. The most prominently observed class of posttranslational modifications was oxidative modifications. This study reveals approximately 500 new or previously unconfirmed plant mitochondrial proteins and outlines a facile strategy for unbiased, near-comprehensive identification of mitochondrial proteins and their modified forms. © 2014 American Society of Plant Biologists.

abstract={RepeatsDB (http://repeatsdb.bio.unipd.it/) is a database of annotated tandem repeat protein structures. Tandem repeats pose a difficult problem for the analysis of protein structures, as the underlying sequence can be highly degenerate. Several repeat types haven been studied over the years, but their annotation was done in a case-by-case basis, thus making large-scale analysis difficult. We developed RepeatsDB to fill this gap. Using state-of-the-art repeat detection methods and manual curation, we systematically annotated the Protein Data Bank, predicting 10 745 repeat structures. In all, 2797 structures were classified according to a recently proposed classification schema, which was expanded to accommodate new findings. In addition, detailed annotations were performed in a subset of 321 proteins. These annotations feature information on start and end positions for the repeat regions and units. RepeatsDB is an ongoing effort to systematically classify and annotate structural protein repeats in a consistent way. It provides users with the possibility to access and download high-quality datasets either interactively or programmatically through web services. © 2013 The Author(s).

abstract={Repetition of a structural motif within protein is associated with a wide range of structural and functional roles. In most cases the repeating units are well conserved at the structural level while at the sequence level, they are mostly undetectable suggesting the need for structure-based methods. Since most known methods require a training dataset, de novo approach is desirable. Here, we propose an efficient graph-based approach for detecting structural repeats in proteins. In a protein structure represented as a graph, interactions between inter-and intra-repeat units are well captured by the eigen spectra of adjacency matrix of the graph. These conserved interactions give rise to similar connections and a unique profile of the principal eigen spectra for each repeating unit. The efficacy of the approach is shown on eight repeat families annotated in UniProt, comprising of both solenoid and nonsolenoid repeats with varied secondary structure architecture and repeat lengths. The performance of the approach is also tested on other known benchmark datasets and the performance compared with two repeat identification methods. For a known repeat type, the algorithm also identifies the type of repeat present in the protein.

abstract={Mitochondria and chloroplasts are often described as semi-autonomous organelles because they have retained a genome. They thus require fully functional gene expression machineries. Many of the required processes going all the way from transcription to translation have specificities in organelles and arose during eukaryote history. Most factors involved in these RNA maturation steps have remained elusive for a long time. The recent identification of a number of novel protein families including pentatricopeptide repeat proteins, half-a-tetratricopeptide proteins, octotricopeptide repeat proteins and mitochondrial transcription termination factors has helped to settle long-standing questions regarding organelle gene expression. In particular, their functions have been related to replication, transcription, RNA processing, RNA editing, splicing, the control of RNA turnover and translation throughout eukaryotes. These families of proteins, although evolutionary independent, seem to share a common overall architecture. For all of them, proteins contain tandem arrays of repeated motifs. Each module is composed of two to three α-helices and their succession forms a super-helix. Here, we review the features characterising these protein families, in particular, their distribution, the identified functions and mode of action and propose that they might share similar substrate recognition mechanisms. © 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Chemosensory systems and TCS both modulate phosphorelays comprised of histidine kinases and response regulators, some of which are single-domain response regulators (SD-RRs) such as CheY. In this study, we have identified and characterized the Che7 chemosensory system of Myxococcus xanthus, a common soil bacterium which displays multicellular development in response to stress. Both genetic and biochemical analyses indicate that the Che7 system regulates development via a direct interaction between the SD-RR CheY7 and a HEAT repeat domain-containing protein, Cpc7. Phosphorylation of the SD-RR affects the interaction with its target, and residues within the α4-β5-α5 fold of the REC domain govern this interaction. The identification of the Cpc7 interaction with CheY7 extends the diversity of known targets for SD-RRs in biological systems. © 2014, American Society for Microbiology.},

abstract={Retromer is a protein assembly that orchestrates the sorting of transmembrane cargo proteins into endosome-to-Golgi and endosome-to-plasma-membrane transport pathways. Here, we have employed quantitative proteomics to define the interactome of human VPS35, the core retromer component. This has identified a number of new interacting proteins, including ankyrin-repeat domain 50 (ANKRD50), seriologically defined colon cancer antigen 3 (SDCCAG3) and VPS9-ankyrin-repeat protein (VARP, also known as ANKRD27). Depletion of these proteins resulted in trafficking defects of retromer-dependent cargo, but differential and cargospecific effects suggested a surprising degree of functional heterogeneity in retromer-mediated endosome-to-plasma-membrane sorting. Extending this, suppression of the retromer-associatedWASH complex did not uniformly affect retromer cargo, thereby confirming cargo-specific functions for retromer-interacting proteins. Further analysis of the retromer-VARP interaction identified a role for retromer in endosome-to-melanosome transport. Suppression of VPS35 led to mistrafficking of the melanogenic enzymes, tyrosinase and tryrosine-related protein 1 (Tyrp1), establishing that retromer acts in concert with VARP in this trafficking pathway. Overall, these data reveal hidden complexities in retromer-mediated sorting and open up new directions in our molecular understanding of this essential sorting complex.},

abstract={Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) are devastating neurodegenerative diseases that form two ends of a complex disease spectrum. Aggregation of RNA binding proteins is one of the hallmark pathologic features of ALS and FTDL and suggests perturbance of the RNA metabolism in their etiology. Recent identification of the disease-associated expansions of the intronic hexanucleotide repeat GGGGCC in the C9ORF72 gene further substantiates the case for RNA involvement. The expanded repeat, which has turned out to be the single most common genetic cause of ALS and FTLD, may enable the formation of complex DNA and RNA structures, changes in RNA transcription, and processing and formation of toxic RNA foci, which may sequester and inactivate RNA binding proteins. Additionally, the transcribed expanded repeat can undergo repeat-associated non-ATG-initiated translation resulting in accumulation of a series of dipeptide repeat proteins. Understanding the basis of the proposed mechanisms and shared pathways, as well as interactions with known key proteins such as TAR DNA-binding protein (TDP-43) are needed to clarify the pathology of ALS and/or FTLD, and make possible steps toward therapy development. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Summary: Bacterial secretion systems often employ molecular chaperones to recognize and facilitate export of their substrates. Recent work demonstrated that a secreted component of the type VI secretion system (T6SS), haemolysin co-regulated protein (Hcp), binds directly to effectors, enhancing their stability in the bacterial cytoplasm. Herein, we describe a quantitative cellular proteomics screen for T6S substrates that exploits this chaperone-like quality of Hcp. Application of this approach to the Hcp secretion island I-encoded T6SS (H1-T6SS) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa led to the identification of a novel effector protein, termed Tse4 (type VI secretion exported 4), subsequently shown to act as a potent intra-specific H1-T6SS-delivered antibacterial toxin. Interestingly, our screen failed to identify two predicted H1-T6SS effectors, Tse5 and Tse6, which differ from Hcp-stabilized substrates by the presence of toxin-associated PAAR-repeat motifs and genetic linkage to members of the valine-glycine repeat protein G (vgrG) genes. Genetic studies further distinguished these two groups of effectors: Hcp-stabilized effectors were found to display redundancy in interbacterial competition with respect to the requirement for the two H1-T6SS-exported VgrG proteins, whereas Tse5 and Tse6 delivery strictly required a cognate VgrG. Together, we propose that interaction with either VgrG or Hcp defines distinct pathways for T6S effector export. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract={A novel dominant resistance gene, TuRB07, was found to confer resistance to an isolate of TuMV strain C4 in B. rapa line VC1 and mapped on the top of chromosome A06. The inheritance of resistance to Turnip mosaic virus in Brassica rapa was investigated by crossing the resistant line, VC1 with the susceptible line, SR5, and genotyping and phenotyping diverse progenies derived from this cross. Both a doubled haploid population, VCS3M-DH, an F2 and two BC1 (F1 × VC1 and F1 × SR5) populations were created. Population tests revealed that the resistance to the TuMV C4 isolate in B. rapa is controlled by a single dominant gene. This resistance gene, TuRB07 was positioned on the top of linkage group A06 of the B. rapa genome through bulk segregation analysis and fine mapping recombinants in three doubled haploid- and one backcross population using microsatellite markers developed from BAC end sequences. Within the region between the two closely linked markers flanking TuRB07, H132A24-s1, and KS10960, in the Chiifu reference genome, two genes encoding nucleotide-binding site and leucine-rich repeat proteins with a coiled-coil motif (CC-NBS-LRR), Bra018862 and Bra018863 were identified as candidate resistance genes. The gene Bra018862 is truncated, but the gene Bra018863 has all the domains to function. Furthermore, the analysis of structural variation using resequencing data of VC1 and SR5 revealed that Bra018863 might be a functional gene because the gene has no structural variation in the resistant line VC1 when compared with Chiifu, whereas at the other NBS-LRR genes large deletions were identified in the resistant line. Allelic differences of Bra018863 were found between VC1 and SR5, supporting the notion that this gene is a putative candidate gene for the virus resistance.},

abstract={Summary RNA editing modifies cytidines (C) to uridines (U) at specific sites in the transcripts of mitochondria and plastids, altering the amino acid specified by the DNA sequence. Here we report the identification of a critical editing factor of mitochondrial nad7 transcript via molecular characterization of a small kernel 1 (smk1) mutant in Zea mays (maize). Mutations in Smk1 arrest both the embryo and endosperm development. Cloning of Smk1 indicates that it encodes an E-subclass pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) protein that is targeted to mitochondria. Loss of SMK1 function abolishes the C → U editing at the nad7-836 site, leading to the retention of a proline codon that is edited to encode leucine in the wild type. The smk1 mutant showed dramatically reduced complex-I assembly and NADH dehydrogenase activity, and abnormal biogenesis of the mitochondria. Analysis of the ortholog in Oryza sativa (rice) reveals that rice SMK1 has a conserved function in C → U editing of the mitochondrial nad7-836 site. T-DNA knock-out mutants showed abnormal embryo and endosperm development, resulting in embryo or seedling lethality. The leucine at NAD7-279 is highly conserved from bacteria to flowering plants, and analysis of genome sequences from many plants revealed a molecular coevolution between the requirement for C → U editing at this site and the existence of an SMK1 homolog. These results demonstrate that Smk1 encodes a PPR-E protein that is required for nad7-836 editing, and this editing is critical to NAD7 function in complex-I assembly in mitochondria, and hence to embryo and endosperm development in maize and rice. © 2014 The Authors The Plant Journal © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract={The stability of the repeat protein IκBα, a transcriptional inhibitor in mammalian cells, is critical in the functioning of the NF-κB signaling module implicated in an array of cellular processes, including cell growth, disease, immunity and apoptosis. Structurally, IκBα is complex, with both ordered and disordered regions, thus posing a challenge to the available computational protocols to model its conformational behavior. Here, we introduce a simple procedure to model disorder in systems that undergo binding-induced folding that involves modulation of the contact map guided by equilibrium experimental observables in combination with an Ising-like Wako-Saitô-Muñoz-Eaton model. This one-step procedure alone is able to reproduce a variety of experimental observables, including ensemble thermodynamics (scanning calorimetry, pre-transitions, m-values) and kinetics (roll-over in chevron plot, intermediates and their identity), and is consistent with hydrogen-deuterium exchange measurements. We further capture the intricate distance-dynamics between the domains as measured by single-molecule FRET by combining the model predictions with simple polymer physics arguments. Our results reveal a unique mechanism at work in IκBα folding, wherein disorder in one domain initiates a domino-like effect partially destabilizing neighboring domains, thus highlighting the effect of symmetry-breaking at the level of primary sequences. The offshoot is a multi-state and a dynamic conformational landscape that is populated by increasingly partially folded ensembles upon destabilization. Our results provide, in a straightforward fashion, a rationale to the promiscuous binding and short intracellular half-life of IκBα evolutionarily engineered into it through repeats with variable stabilities and expand the functional repertoire of disordered regions in proteins. © 2013 Sivanandan, Naganathan.},

abstract={The Xin actin-binding repeat-containing proteins Xin and XIRP2 are exclusively expressed in striated muscle cells, where they are believed to play an important role in development. In adult muscle, both proteins are concentrated at attachment sites of myofibrils to the membrane. In contrast, during development they are localized to immature myofibrils together with their binding partner, filamin C, indicating an involvement of both proteins in myofibril assembly. We identify the SH3 domains of nebulin and nebulette as novel ligands of proline-rich regions of Xin and XIRP2. Precise binding motifs are mapped and shown to bind both SH3 domains with micromolar affinity. Cocrystallization of the nebulette SH3 domain with the interacting XIRP2 peptide PPPTLPKPKLPKH reveals selective interactions that conform to class II SH3 domain-binding peptides. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation experiments in cultured muscle cells indicate a temporally restricted interaction of Xin-repeat proteins with nebulin/nebulette during early stages of myofibril development that is lost upon further maturation. In mature myofibrils, this interaction is limited to longitudinally oriented structures associated with myofibril development and remodeling. These data provide new insights into the role of Xin actin-binding repeat-containing proteins (together with their interaction partners) in myofibril assembly and after muscle damage. © 2013 Eulitz et al.},

abstract={Plant microRNAs (miRNAs) post-transcriptionally regulate target gene expression to modulate growth and development and biotic and abiotic stress responses. By analyzing small RNA deep sequencing data in combination with the genome sequence, we identified 75 conserved miRNAs and 11 novel miRNAs. Their target genes were also predicted. For most conserved miRNAs, the miRNA-target pairs were conserved across plant species. In addition to these conserved miRNA-target pairs, we also identified some papaya-specific miRNA-target regulatory pathways. Both miR168 and miR530 target the Argonaute 1 gene, indicating a second autoregulatory mechanism for miRNA regulation. A non-conserved miRNA was mapped within an intron of Dicer-like 1 (DCL1), suggesting a conserved homeostatic autoregulatory mechanism for DCL1 expression. A 21-nt miRNA triggers secondary siRNA production from its target genes, nucleotide-binding site leucine-rich repeat protein genes. Certain phased-miRNAs were processed from their conserved miRNA precursors, indicating a putative miRNA evolution mechanism. In addition, we identified a Carica papaya-specific miRNA that targets an ethylene receptor gene, implying its function in the ethylene signaling pathway.

abstract={Background: Protrusions of cancer cells conferrers a vital function for cell migration and metastasis. Protein and RNA localization mechanisms have been extensively examined and shown to play pivotal roles for the functional presence of specific protein components in cancer cell protrusions.Methods: To describe genome wide RNA localized in protrusions of the metastatic human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 we used Boyden chamber based methodology followed by direct mRNA sequencing.Results: In the hereby identified group of protrusion localized mRNA some previously were described to be localized exemplified by mRNA for Ras-Related protein 13 (RAB13) and p0071 (Plakophilin-4/PKP4). For other transcripts, exemplified by mRNA for SH3PXD2A/TKS5 and PPFIA1/Liprin-α1, only the corresponding proteins previously were described to have protrusion localization. Finally, a cohort of MDA-MB-231 protrusion localized transcripts represents novel candidates to mediate cancer cell subcellular region specific functions through mRNA direction to protrusions. We included a further characterization of p0071, an armadillo repeat protein of adherence junctions and desmosomes, in MDA-MB-231 and non-metastatic MCF7 cells including analysis of novel identified alternative spliced p0071 mRNA isoforms. The results showed isoform and cell type specific p0071 mRNA localization.Conclusions: Altogether, the presented data represents a genome wide and gene specific descriptive and functional analyses of RNA localization in protrusions of MDA-MB-231 metastatic cancer cells. © 2013 Jakobsen et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={Dried blood spot (DBS) sampling methods are desirable for population-wide biomarker screening programs because of their ease of collection, transportation, and storage. Immunoassays are traditionally used to quantify endogenous proteins in these samples but require a separate assay for each protein. Recently, targeted mass spectrometry (MS) has been proposed for generating highly-multiplexed assays for biomarker proteins in DBS samples. In this work, we report the first comparison of proteins in whole blood and DBS samples using an untargeted MS approach. The average number of proteins identified in undepleted whole blood and DBS samples by liquid chromatography (LC)/MS/MS was 223 and 253, respectively. Protein identification repeatability was between 77 %-92 % within replicates and the majority of these repeated proteins (70 %) were observed in both sample formats. Proteins exclusively identified in the liquid or dried fluid spot format were unbiased based on their molecular weight, isoelectric point, aliphatic index, and grand average hydrophobicity. In addition, we extended this comparison to include proteins in matching plasma and serum samples with their dried fluid spot equivalents, dried plasma spot (DPS), and dried serum spot (DSS). This work begins to define the accessibility of endogenous proteins in dried fluid spot samples for analysis by MS and is useful in evaluating the scope of this new approach.

abstract={Intraflagellar transport (IFT) is a microtubule based system that supports the assembly and maintenance of cilia. Genetic and biochemical studies have identified two distinct complexes containing multiple proteins that are part of the IFT machinery. In this study we prepared mouse pituitary cells that expressed an epitope-tagged IFT protein and immuno-purified the IFT B complex from these cells. Mass spectrometry analysis of the isolated complex led to identification of a number of well known components of the IFT B complex. In addition, peptides corresponding to mouse tetratricopeptide repeat proteins, TTC30A1, TTC30A2 and TTC30B were identified. The mouse Ttc30A1, Ttc30A2, Ttc30B genes are orthologs of Caenorhabditis elegans dyf-1, which is required for assembly of the distal segment of the cilia. We used co-immunoprecipitation studies to provide evidence that, TTC30A1, TTC30A2 or TTC30B can be incorporated into a complex with a known IFT B protein, IFT52. We also found that TTC30B can interact with mouse KIF17, a kinesin which participates in IFT. In vitro expression in a cell-free system followed by co-immunoprecipitation also provided evidence that TTC30B can directly interact with several different IFT B complex proteins. The findings support the view that mouse TTC30A1, TTC30A2 and TTC30B can contribute to the IFT B complex, likely through interactions with multiple IFT proteins and also suggest a possible link to the molecular motor, KIF17 to support transport of cargo during IFT. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={The ankyrin repeat (ANK) protein family plays a crucial role in plant growth and development and in response to biotic and abiotic stresses. However, no detailed information concerning this family is available for tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) due to the limited information on whole genome sequences. In this study, we identified a total of 130 ANK genes in tomato genome (SlANK), and these genes were distributed across all 12 chromosomes at various densities. And chromosomal localizations of SlANK genes indicated 25 SlANK genes were involved in tandem duplications. Based on their domain composition, all of the SlANK proteins were grouped into 13 subgroups. A combined phylogenetic tree was constructed with the aligned SlANK protein sequences. This tree revealed that the SlANK proteins comprise five major groups. An analysis of the expression profiles of SlANK genes in tomato in different tissues and in response to stresses showed that the SlANK proteins play roles in plant growth, development and stress responses. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a genome-wide analysis of the tomato ANK gene family.

abstract={A complex of R2R3-MYB and bHLH transcription factors, stabilized by WD40 repeat proteins, regulates gene transcription for plant cell pigmentation and epidermal cell morphology. It is the MYB component of this complex which specifies promoter target activation. The Arabidopsis MYB TT2 regulates proanthocyanidin (PA) biosynthesis by activating the expression of ANR (anthocyanidin reductase), the gene product of which catalyzes the first committed step of this pathway. Conversely the closely related MYB PAP4 (AtMYB114) regulates the anthocyanin pathway and specifically activates UFGT (UDP-glucose:flavonoid-3-O-glucosyltransferase), encoding the first enzyme of the anthocyanin pathway. Both at the level of structural and regulatory genes, evolution of PA biosynthesis proceeded anthocyanin biosynthesis and we have identified key residues in these MYB transcription factors for the evolution of target promoter specificity. Using chimeric and point mutated variants of TT2 and PAP4 we found that exchange of a single amino acid, Gly/Arg39 in the R2 domain combined with an exchange of a four amino acid motif in the R3 domain, could swap the pathway selection of TT2 and PAP4, thereby converting in planta specificity of the PA towards the anthocyanin pathway and vice versa. The general importance of these amino acids for target specificity was also shown for the grapevine transcription factors VvMYBPA2 and VvMYBA2 which regulate PAs and anthocyanins, respectively. These results provide an insight into the evolution of the different flavonoid regulators from a common ancestral gene. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={WD40-repeat proteins (WD40s), as one of the largest protein families in eukaryotes, play vital roles in assembling protein-protein/DNA/RNA complexes. WD40s fold into similar β-propeller structures despite diversified sequences. A program WDSP (WD40 repeat protein Structure Predictor) has been developed to accurately identify WD40 repeats and predict their secondary structures. The method is designed specifically for WD40 proteins by incorporating both local residue information and non-local family-specific structural features. It overcomes the problem of highly diversified protein sequences and variable loops. In addition, WDSP achieves a better prediction in identifying multiple WD40-domain proteins by taking the global combination of repeats into consideration. In secondary structure prediction, the average Q3 accuracy of WDSP in jack-knife test reaches 93.7%. A disease related protein LRRK2 was used as a representive example to demonstrate the structure prediction. © 2013 Wang et al.},

abstract={Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) inherits the active mutation, which promotes the viral survival in human and is the main hurdle of vaccine development. The mutations on HIV surface i.e. CD4 binding site on HIV gp120, causes the escaping from the immune-surveillance but still retains the infectivity for CD4+ T cells. Formerly, Designed Ankyrin Repeat Protein (DARPin) technology has been innovated to inhibit the HIV infection. The CD4-specific DARPin specifically excludes the adhesion step of HIV to CD4 molecule and efficiently prevents HIV infection in vitro by competing with gp120, however, not in vivo. Therefore, insight into the interaction between DARPin and CD4 molecules will provide the information to improve the interaction affinity of DARPin for in vivo purpose. The binding activity can be modified by directly defining the key amino acid residues of CD4-specific DARPin and replacing them with other possible residues. To discover the remarkable CD4's residues, a molecular docking software i.e. ZDOCK was used to predict the complex structures between CD4 and DARPin. In this study, the candidate residues of CD4-specific DARPin were identified by the residues of CD4 molecule involving in gp120 interaction. The defined DARPin poses that interrelated with them were then extracted. The MATLAB software was implemented to generate the assigned screening criteria for recruiting the most relevant binding residues in eleven complex-structure-candidates derived from ZDOCK. The invented data processing methodology will assist the molecular simulation researchers to rapidly and precisely define important residues.},

abstract={Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are important initiators in innate immune responses against pathogenic microbes such as viruses, intracellular bacteria or parasites. Although the innate immune system is designed to fight infectious pathogens, excessive activation of TLR signaling may lead to unwarranted inflammation with hazardous outcomes. Mechanisms of restraining excessive inflammation and controlling homeostasis for innate immunity are the focus of intense study. Here we showed that LRRC33, a novel member of leucine-rich repeat (LRR) protein family, plays a critical role in desensitizing TLR signaling. LRRC33 is TLR homolog that contains 17 putative LRRs in the extracellular region but lacks a cytoplasmic Toll/IL-1 receptor (TIR) domain. Expression of LRRC33 appears to be ubiquitous with high level of expression found in bone marrow, thymus, liver, lung, intestine and spleen. The LRRs of LRRC33 is required for the interaction with TLR and its inhibitory effect on NF-κB and AP-1 activation as well as cytokine production. Our study sheds new insight into the TLR signaling and inflammatory response in development and human diseases. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Ethylene receptors play important roles not only in regulation of growth and development but also in response to environmental stimuli of plants. However, there are few reports on ethylene receptors in soybean. In this article, putative ethylene receptors of soybean were searched from soybean genomic database (http://www.phytozome.net/search.php) and analyzed. The ethylene receptor gene family in soybean comprising eight members, designated as GmERS1-1, GmERS1-2, GmETR1-1, GmETR1-2, GmETR2-1, GmETR2-2, GmEIN4-1, and GmEIN4-2 corresponding with their homologous genes in Arabidopsis, were isolated and analyzed. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the eight soybean ethylene receptors (SERs) were in two subfamilies and further divided into four groups, viz., groups I (GmERS1-1 and GmERS1-2), II (GmETR1-1 and GmETR1-2), VI (GmETR2-1 and GmETR2-2), and VII (GmEIN4-1 and GmEIN4-2). Protein structure of the members in groups I and II from subfamily I were more conserved than the members in other two groups from subfamily II. Expression patterns of the SERs were compared with the homologous genes in Arabidopsis. The results demonstrated that expression patterns of the SERs differed from Arabidopsis members in the same group, suggesting that SERs are involved in different signal pathways compared to ethylene receptors in Arabidopsis. Promoter analysis showed that the sequences of the members in each group were different from each other, and some specific binding elements of transcription factors detected in promoter sequences might explain the differences between the members in the same group. A novel soybean TPR protein (tetratricopeptide repeat protein), GmTPR, was identified to interact with GmETR1-1, apparently an important ethylene receptor in ethylene signaling pathway in soybean. This suggested that GmTPR might be a novel downstream component of the ethylene signaling pathway. © 2013 Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences.},

abstract={Leptospirosis is considered to be a re-emerging disease that has impacts on public health both globally and in and Thailand. The leptospires outbreak in Thailand during 1999 was largely due to the etiologic agent Leptospira borgpetersenii serogroup Sejroe. This had a related immunity profile in cows from Thailand, which serovars Tarassovi and Sejroe were prevalent. Development of a vaccine protecting against leptospiral infection in livestock has been considered. One family of proteins being targeted as candidates for vaccine development are leucine-rich repeats (LRRs), which have diverse functions such as bacterial host-pathogen interactions, membrane anchoring, invasion and stimulating host defense mechanisms. Identifying leptospiral LRR proteins containing immunogenic epitopes is important for Leptospirosis vaccine development. In this study, we searched LRR genes from L. borgpetersenii serovar Hardjo-bovis strain L550 and LB179 genomic databases in an attempt to find appropriate LRR proteins for vaccine candidates covering the common genospecies detected in Thailand. The in silico analysis, LRR protein secondary and tertiary structures by 3D modeling, and T cell epitope prediction &amp; analysis were performed. In conclusion, we have found seven pairs of conserved LRR genes in L. borpetersenii serovars Hardjo-bovis strains JB197 and L550. Only the LBJ_2271 gene was predicted to be LRR motif subfamily membrane protein with an N-terminal signal sequence, 2 transmembrane domains and an N-glycosylated site. The LRR consensus sequence LXXLXLXXNXL was classified in a typical LRR subfamily. The LBJ_2271 gene sequence has highly homology to genes in other pathogenic Leptospira interrogans serovars; LA_1324, LIC_12401, JX26069, JX26070, JX26071 and JX06072. The LBJ_2271 protein was predicted to containin 14 T cell epitopes, 8 of which are predicted T cell epitopes for Major-Histo-Compatability (MHC) alleles HLA-A*0101, A*0202, A*0203, A*1101, A*3101, A*6802, and HLA-DRB*0401 and DRB*0701, with IC50 values of 0.90-32.28nM, residing outside of the transmembrane domains. At least 5 promising predicted T cell epitopes for alleles HLA-A0202, -A0203, -A1101, -DRB0401 and -DRB0701 had their IC50 lower - equal to IC50 values for the same allele epitopes of known antigenic proteins LigA, LipL32, OMPL1 and LipL36. This study has successfully identified LBJ_2271 as a protein candidate for further study of antigenic immune stimulation for vaccine development. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Background: Red colour in kiwifruit results from the presence of anthocyanin pigments. Their expression, however, is complex, and varies among genotypes, species, tissues and environments. An understanding of the biosynthesis, physiology and genetics of the anthocyanins involved, and the control of their expression in different tissues, is required. A complex, the MBW complex, consisting of R2R3-MYB and bHLH transcription factors together with a WD-repeat protein, activates anthocyanin 3-O-galactosyltransferase (F3GT1) to produce anthocyanins. We examined the expression and genetic control of anthocyanins in flowers of Actinidia hybrid families segregating for red and white petal colour. Results: Four inter-related backcross families between Actinidia chinensis Planch. var. chinensis and Actinidia eriantha Benth. were identified that segregated 1:1 for red or white petal colour. Flower pigments consisted of five known anthocyanins (two delphinidin-based and three cyanidin-based) and three unknowns. Intensity and hue differed in red petals from pale pink to deep magenta, and while intensity of colour increased with total concentration of anthocyanin, no association was found between any particular anthocyanin data and hue. Real time qPCR demonstrated that an R2R3 MYB, MYB110a, was expressed at significant levels in red-petalled progeny, but not in individuals with white petals.A microsatellite marker was developed that identified alleles that segregated with red petal colour, but not with ovary, stamen filament, or fruit flesh colour in these families. The marker mapped to chromosome 10 in Actinidia. The white petal phenotype was complemented by syringing Agrobacterium tumefaciens carrying Actinidia 35S::MYB110a into the petal tissue. Red pigments developed in white petals both with, and without, co-transformation with Actinidia bHLH partners. MYB110a was shown to directly activate Actinidia F3GT1 in transient assays. Conclusions: The transcription factor, MYB110a, regulates anthocyanin production in petals in this hybrid population, but not in other flower tissues or mature fruit. The identification of delphinidin-based anthocyanins in these flowers provides candidates for colour enhancement in novel fruits. © 2013 Fraser et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={C-to-U RNA editing has been widely observed in organellar RNAs in terrestrial plants. Recent research has revealed the significance of a large, plant-specific family of pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins for RNA editing and other RNA processing events in plant mitochondria and chloroplasts. PPR protein is a sequence-specific RNA-binding protein that identifies specific C residues for editing. Discovery of the RNA recognition code for PPR motifs, including verification and prediction of the individual RNA editing site and its corresponding PPR protein, expanded our understanding of the molecular function of PPR proteins in plant organellar RNA editing. Using this knowledge and the co-expression database, we have identified two new PPR proteins that mediate chloroplast RNA editing. Further, computational target assignment using the PPR RNA recognition codes suggests a distinct, unknown mode-of-action, by which PPR proteins serve a function beyond site recognition in RNA editing. © 2013 Landes Bioscience.},

abstract={It is well recognized that flowering plants maintain a particularly broad spectrum of factors to support gene expression in mitochondria. Many of these factors are pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins that participate in virtually all processes dealing with RNA. One of these processes is the post-transcriptional generation of mature 5′ termini of RNA. Several PPR proteins are required for efficient 5′ maturation of mitochondrial mRNA and rRNA. These socalled RNA PROCESSING FACTORs (RPF) exclusively represent P-class PPR proteins, mainly composed of canonical PPR motifs without any extra domains. Applying the recent PPRnucleotide recognition code, binding sites of RPF are predicted on the 5′ leader sequences. The sequence-specific interaction of an RPF with one or a few RNA substrates probably directly or indirectly recruits an as-yet-unidentified endonuclease to the processing site(s). The identification and characterization of RPF is a major step toward the understanding of the role of 5′ end maturation in flowering plant mitochondria. © 2013 Landes Bioscience.},

abstract={Strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa) fruits contain high concentrations of flavonoids. In unripe strawberries, the flavonoids are mainly represented by proanthocyanidins (PAs), while in ripe fruits the red-coloured anthocyanins also accumulate. Most of the structural genes leading to PA biosynthesis in strawberry have been characterized, but no information is available on their transcriptional regulation. In Arabidopsis thaliana the expression of the PA biosynthetic genes is specifically induced by a ternary protein complex, composed of AtTT2 (AtMYB123), AtTT8 (AtbHLH042) and AtTTG1 (WD40-repeat protein). A strategy combining yeast-two-hybrid screening and agglomerative hierarchical clustering of transcriptomic and metabolomic data was undertaken to identify strawberry PA regulators. Among the candidate genes isolated, four were similar to AtTT2, AtTT8 and AtTTG1 (FaMYB9/FaMYB11, FabHLH3 and FaTTG1, respectively) and two encode putative negative regulators (FaMYB5 and FabHLH3{increment}). Interestingly, FaMYB9/FaMYB11, FabHLH3 and FaTTG1 were found to complement the tt2-1, tt8-3 and ttg1-1 transparent testa mutants, respectively. In addition, they interacted in yeast and activated the Arabidopsis BANYULS (anthocyanidin reductase) gene promoter when coexpressed in Physcomitrella patens protoplasts. Taken together, these results demonstrated that FaMYB9/FaMYB11, FabHLH3 and FaTTG1 are the respective functional homologues of AtTT2, AtTT8 and AtTTG1, providing new tools for modifying PA content and strawberry fruit quality. © 2012 The Authors.

abstract={A new member of the WD repeat protein family, named GhWD40, was cloned from a near-isogenic line for glands in cotton. It has 2629 bp cDNA and a complete opening reading frame (ORF) of 1239 bp, containing the initial code (ATG) and terminal code (TAG); there is a 1061 bp non-coding sequence at the 5′-end, and a 329 bp non-coding sequence at the 3′-end, including the poly(A) sequence (accession number: JN714279). The predicted protein of the complete ORF comprised 412 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 47.1 kDa and an isoelectric point of 8.88. Protein domain scanning showed that the novel protein has five wd40 motifs and belongs to the WD40 family. From a search for GhWD40 cDNA and amino acid sequences in the database, it has 77% sequence identity and was 90% sequence positive with the WD-40 repeat protein from Trifolium pratense (accession number BAE71307.1), and 80% sequence identity and 89% sequence positivity with the ribosome biogenesis protein bop1 from Ricinus communis (accession number XP 002529002.1). We propose that GhWD40 may play the same role as bop1. In addition, expression of GhWD40 in near-isogenic lines 11 and 3 (with and without glands, respectively) was studied by quantitative RT-polymerase chain reaction, and the level in near-isogenic line 11 was higher than that in near-isogenic line 3, suggesting that GhWD40 may be related to gland formation. © 2012 Versita Warsaw and Springer-Verlag Wien.},

abstract={Motivation: Repeat proteins form a distinct class of structures where folding is greatly simplified. Several classes have been defined, with solenoid repeats of periodicity between ca. 5 and 40 being the most challenging to detect. Such proteins evolve quickly and their periodicity may be rapidly hidden at sequence level. From a structural point of view, finding solenoids may be complicated by the presence of insertions or multiple domains. To the best of our knowledge, no automated methods are available to characterize solenoid repeats from structure. Results: Here we introduce RAPHAEL, a novel method for the detection of solenoids in protein structures. It reliably solves three problems of increasing difficulty: (1) recognition of solenoid domains, (2) determination of their periodicity and (3) assignment of insertions. RAPHAEL uses a geometric approach mimicking manual classification, producing several numeric parameters that are optimized for maximum performance. The resulting method is very accurate, with 89.5% of solenoid proteins and 97.2% of non-solenoid proteins correctly classified. RAPHAEL periodicities have a Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.877 against the manually established ones. A baseline algorithm for insertion detection in identified solenoids has a Q2 value of 79.8%, suggesting room for further improvement. RAPHAEL finds 1931 highly confident repeat structures not previously annotated as solenoids in the Protein Data Bank records. © 2012 The Author.},

abstract={An F2 population was developed from a cross between a mur-cytoplasmic male sterile broccoli line and a restorer Chinese kale line. Phenotypic analysis of F2 plants indicated that the pollen fertility is controlled by two genes and segregated in a duplicate gene interaction mode with a ratio of 15:1. A total of 236 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers were developed utilizing 1,448 primers designed for production of expressed sequence tag (EST)-SNP markers of Raphanus sativus and analyzed by the dot-blot technique in 205 F2 individuals. A linkage map was constructed with a total of 142 markers and these markers were assigned to nine linkage groups together with simple sequence repeat markers mapped previously on the published linkage maps of Brassica oleracea. The linkage map spanned 909 cM with an average marker distance of 6.4 cM. A fertility restorer locus (Rfm1) was mapped on LG1, corresponding to chromosome 3, along with a flower color locus at a distance of 25 cM. SNP markers flanking the Rfm1 locus were BoCL2642s at a distance of 2.5 cM on one side and BoCL2901s at a distance of 7.5 cM on the other side. All the SNP markers showed homology with Arabidopsis thaliana and Brassica rapa genome sequences. Three pentatricopeptide repeat genes of the P-subfamily, particularly expressed in buds of the restorer line, were identified and these genes could be potential candidate fertility restorer genes. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract={The bioinformatics analysis of proteins containing tandem repeats requires special computer programs and databases, since the conventional approaches predominantly developed for globular domains have limited success. Here, I survey bioinformatics tools which have been developed recently for identification and proteome-wide analysis of protein repeats. The last few years have also been marked by an emergence of new 3D structures of these proteins. Appraisal of the known structures and their classification uncovers a straightforward relationship between their architecture and the length of the repetitive units. This relationship and the repetitive character of structural folds suggest rules for better prediction of the 3D structures of such proteins. Furthermore, bioinformatics approaches combined with low resolution structural data, from biophysical techniques, especially, the recently emerged cryo-electron microscopy, lead to reliable prediction of the protein repeat structures and their mode of binding with partners within molecular complexes. This hybrid approach can actively be used for structural and functional annotations of proteomes. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Cellulose synthase (CesA) genes constitute a complex multigene family with six major phylogenetic clades in angiosperms. The recently sequenced genome of domestic apple, Malus-domestica was mined for CesA genes, by blasting full-length cellulose synthase protein (CESA) sequences annotated in the apple genome against protein databases from the plant models Arabidopsis thaliana and Populus trichocarpa. Thirteen genes belonging to the six angiosperm CesA clades and coding for proteins with conserved residues typical of processive glycosyltransferases from family 2 were detected. Based on their phylogenetic relationship to Arabidopsis CESAs, as well as expression patterns, a nomenclature is proposed to facilitate further studies. Examination of their genomic organization revealed that MdCesA8-A is closely linked and co-oriented with WDR53, a gene coding for a WD40 repeat protein. The WDR53 and CesA8 genes display conserved collinearity in dicots and are partially co-expressed in the apple xylem. Interestingly, the presence of a bicistronic WDR53-CesA8A transcript was detected in phytoplasma-infected phloem tissues of apple. The bicistronic transcript contains a spliced intergenic sequence that is predicted to fold into hairpin structures typical of internal ribosome entry sites, suggesting its potential cap-independent translation. Surprisingly, the CesA8A cistron is alternatively spliced and lacks the zinc-binding domain. The possible roles of WDR53 and the alternatively spliced CESA8 variant during cellulose biosynthesis in M.-xdomestica are discussed. © 2012 The Authors.},

abstract={The analysis of 36 available crystal structures of WD40 repeat proteins reveals widespread existence of a beta-bulge formed at the beginning of strand a and the end of strand b, termed as WDb-a bulge: among a total of 259 WD40 blades, there are 243 such β-bulges. The R1 positions in these WDb-a bulges have fair distributions of Arg, His, Ile, Leu, Lys, Met, Phe, Trp, Tyr and Val residues. These residues protrude on the top face of the WD40 proteins and can serve as hotspots for protein-protein interactions. An analysis of 29 protein complexes formed by 17 WD proteins reveals that these R1 residues, along with two other residues (R1-2 and D-1), are indeed widely involved in protein-protein interactions. Interestingly, these WDb-a bulges can be easily identified by the 4-amino acid sequences of (V, L, I), R1, R2, (V, L, I), along with some other significant amino acids. Thus, the hotspots of WD40 proteins on the top face can be readily predicted based on the primary sequences of the proteins. The literature-reported mutagenesis studies for Met30, MDV1, Tup11, COP1 and SPA1, which crystal structures are not available, can be readily understood based on the feature-based method. Applying the method, the twelve potential hotspots on the top face of Tup11 from S. japonicas have been identified. Our ITC measurements confirm seven of them, Tyr382, Arg284, Tyr426, Tyr508, Leu559, Lys575 and Ile601, are essential for recognizing Fep1. The ITC measurements further convinced that the feature-based method provides accurate prediction of hotspots on the top face. © 2012 Wu et al.},

abstract={The adult mammalian cochlea lacks regenerative ability and the irreversible degeneration of cochlear sensory hair cells leads to permanent hearing loss. Previous data show that early postnatal cochlea harbors stem/progenitor-like cells and shows a limited regenerative/repair capacity. These properties are progressively lost later during the postnatal development. Little is known about the genes and pathways that are potentially involved in this difference of the regenerative/repair potentialities between early postnatal and adult mammalian cochlear sensory epithelia (CSE). The goal of our study is to investigate the transcriptomic profiles of these two stages. We used Mouse Genome 430 2.0 microarray to perform an extensive analysis of the genes expressed in mouse postnatal day-3 (P3) and adult CSE. Statistical analysis of microarray data was performed using SAM (Significance Analysis of Microarrays) software. We identified 5644 statistically significant differentially expressed transcripts with a fold change (FC) >2 and a False Discovery Rate (FDR) ≤0.05. The P3 CSE signature included 3,102 transcripts, among which were known genes in the cochlea, but also new transcripts such as, Hmga2 (high mobility group AT-hook 2) and Nrarp (Notch-regulated ankyrin repeat protein). The adult CSE overexpressed 2,542 transcripts including new transcripts, such as Prl (Prolactin) and Ar (Androgen receptor), that previously were not known to be expressed in the adult cochlea. Our comparative study revealed important genes and pathways differentially expressed between the developing and adult CSE. The identification of new candidate genes would be useful as potential markers of the maintenance or the loss of stem cells and regenerative/repair ability during mammalian cochlear development. © 2012 Smeti et al.},

abstract={Only a few Armadillo (ARM) repeat proteins have been characterized in plants where they appear to have diverse functions, including the regulation of defence responses. In this study, the identification, cloning and characterization of a gene, encoding an ARM repeat protein (GhARM), is described. GhARM exists as multiple copies in cotton, with an 1713 bp ORF encoding 570 amino acids. The predicted protein contains three consecutive ARM repeats within an Armadillo-type fold, with no other distinguishing domains. Sequence alignments and phylogenetic analysis revealed that GhARM has a high homology with other ARM proteins in plants. The predicted three dimensional model of GhARM displayed a characteristic right-handed superhelical twist. In silico analysis of the promoter sequence revealed that it contains several defence- and hormone-responsive cis-regulatory elements. Expression of GhARM was significantly down-regulated in response to treatment with a V. dahliae elicitor suggesting that GhARM may function as a negative-regulator of cotton defence signalling against V. dahliae. To date, GhARM is the only ARM repeat gene that has been completely sequenced and characterized in cotton. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract={The pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) is a helical repeat motif found in an exceptionally large family of RNA-binding proteins that functions in mitochondrial and chloroplast gene expression. PPR proteins harbor between 2 and 30 repeats and typically bind single-stranded RNA in a sequence-specific fashion. However, the basis for sequence-specific RNA recognition by PPR tracts has been unknown. We used computational methods to infer a code for nucleotide recognition involving two amino acids in each repeat, and we validated this model by recoding a PPR protein to bind novel RNA sequences in vitro. Our results show that PPR tracts bind RNA via a modular recognition mechanism that differs from previously described RNA-protein recognition modes and that underpins a natural library of specific protein/RNA partners of unprecedented size and diversity. These findings provide a significant step toward the prediction of native binding sites of the enormous number of PPR proteins found in nature. Furthermore, the extraordinary evolutionary plasticity of the PPR family suggests that the PPR scaffold will be particularly amenable to redesign for new sequence specificities and functions. © 2012 Barkan et al.},

abstract={Pathogenesis of many bacterially-induced inflammatory diseases is driven by Toll-like receptor (TLR) mediated immune responses following recognition of bacterial factors by different TLRs. Periodontitis is a chronic inflammation of the tooth supporting apparatus often leading to tooth loss, and is caused by a Gram-negative bacterial consortium that includes Tannerella forsythia. This bacterium expresses a virulence factor, the BspA, which drives periodontal inflammation by activating TLR2. The N-terminal portion of the BspA protein comprises a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain previously shown to be involved in the binding and activation of TLR2. The objective of the current study was to identify specific epitopes in the LRR domain of BspA that interact with TLR2. Our results demonstrate that a sequence motif GC(S/T)GLXSIT is involved in mediating the interaction of BspA with TLR2. Thus, our study has identified a peptide motif that mediates the binding of a bacterial protein to TLR2 and highlights the promiscuous nature of TLR2 with respect to ligand binding. This work could provide a structural basis for designing peptidomimetics to modulate the activity of TLR2 in order to block bacterially-induced inflammation. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Background: Nesprins (Nuclear envelope spectrin-repeat proteins) are a novel family of giant spectrin-repeat containing proteins. The nesprin-1 and nesprin-2 genes consist of 146 and 116 exons which encode proteins of ~1mDa and ~800 kDa is size respectively when all the exons are utilised in translation. However emerging data suggests that the nesprins have multiple alternative start and termination sites throughout their genes allowing the generation of smaller isoforms. Results: In this study we set out to identify novel alternatively transcribed nesprin variants by screening the EST database and by using RACE analysis to identify cDNA ends. These two methods provided potential hits for alternative start and termination sites that were validated by PCR and DNA sequencing. We show that these alternative sites are not only expressed in a tissue specific manner but by combining different sites together it is possible to create a wide array of nesprin variants. By cloning and expressing small novel nesprin variants into human fibroblasts and U2OS cells we show localization to actin stress-fibres, focal adhesions, microtubules, the nucleolus, nuclear matrix and the nuclear envelope (NE). Furthermore we show that the sub-cellular localization of individual nesprin variants can vary depending on the cell type, suggesting any single nesprin variant may have different functions in different cell types. Conclusions: These studies suggest nesprins act as highly versatile tissue specific intracellular protein scaffolds and identify potential novel functions for nesprins beyond cytoplasmic-nuclear coupling. These alternate functions may also account for the diverse range of disease phenotypes observed when these genes are mutated. © 2012 Rajgor et al.},

abstract={Pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins are members of one of the largest nucleus-encoded protein families in plants. Here, we describe the previously uncharacterized maize (Zea mays) PPR gene, MPPR6, which was isolated from a Mutator-induced collection of maize kernel mutants by a cDNA-based forward genetic approach. Identification of a second mutant allele and cosegregation analysis confirmed correlation with the mutant phenotype. Histological investigations revealed that the mutation coincides with abnormities in the transfer cell layer, retardation of embryo development, and a considerable reduction of starch level. The function of MPPR6 is conserved across a wide phylogenetic distance as revealed by heterologous complementation of the Arabidopsis thaliana mutant in the orthologous APPR6 gene. MPPR6 appeared to be exclusively present in mitochondria. RNA coimmunoprecipitation and in vitro binding studies revealed a specific physical interaction of MPPR6 with the 59 untranslated region of ribosomal protein S3 (rps3) mRNA. Mapping of transcript termini showed specifically extended rps3 59 ends in the mppr6 mutant. Considerable reduction of mitochondrial translation was observed, indicating loss of RPS3 function. This is consistent with the appearance of truncated RPS3 protein lacking the N terminus in mppr6. Our results suggest that MPPR6 is directly involved in 5' maturation and translation initiation of rps3 mRNA. © 2012 American Society of Plant Biologists. All rights reserved.},

In this study, a total of six GPRPs (GmGPRP1 to 6) have been identified in the soybean genome database, and full-length complementary DNA and genomic DNA sequences of GmGPRP3 and GmGPRP4 have been cloned. GmGPRP1-6 genes encoded a set of small predicted proteins (<185aa) with molecular mass of 12.35-19.67 kDa and isoelectric point of 6.79-10.22. GmGPRP1-5 contained three exons and two introns with fixed occurring sites, whereas GmGPRP6 only has two exons and one intron. In the deduced GmGPRP1-5 sequences, six amino acids (glycine, proline, histidine, alanine, lysine and tyrosine) account for more than 75% of the total protein composition. GmGPRPs showed high similarity to other known GPRPs at amino acid level. Most of GPRPs had three conserved regions, including an N-terminal XYPP-repeat domain, a central hydrophobic domain containing several uninterrupted alanine residues and a C-terminal HGK-repeat region. The transcripts of GmGPRP1, 3 and 4 appeared in different organs including seedling leaves, stems and roots, flowers and developing seeds, but every gene showed a unique organ-specific expression pattern. Furthermore, the expression of GmGPRP1, 3 and 4 was significantly induced by drought, salt and cold, but repressed by abscisic acid. In silico analysis of promoter regions of these genes revealed the presence of putative abiotic-stress regulatory elements.

Here we report a rice (Oryza sativa) mutant named young seedling albino (ysa) derived from the rice thermo/photoperiod-sensitive genic male-sterile line Pei'ai64S, which is a leading male-sterile line for commercial two-line hybrid rice production. The ysa mutant develops albino leaves before the three-leaf stage, but the mutant gradually turns green and recovers to normal green at the sixleaf stage. Further investigation showed that the change in leaf color in ysa mutant is associated with changes in chlorophyll content and chloroplast development. Map-based cloning revealed that YSA encodes a PPR protein with 16 tandem PPR motifs. YSA is highly expressed in young leaves and stems, and its expression level is regulated by light. We showed that the ysa mutation has no apparent negative effects on several important agronomic traits, such as fertility, stigma extrusion rate, selfed seed-setting rate, hybrid seed-setting rate, and yield heterosis under normal growth conditions. We further demonstrated that ysa can be used as an early marker for efficient identification and elimination of false hybrids in commercial hybrid rice production, resulting in yield increases by up to approximately 537 kg ha-1. © 2012 American Society of Plant Biologists.

abstract={TAL (transcriptional activator-like) effectors are DNA-binding repeat proteins recently shown to recognize their target sites by an unprecedented, 1:1 mapping between repeat residues and DNA bases. The structural basis for this recognition is not known; in particular, it is not clear whether such 1:1 recognition can be accommodated by standard major-groove readout of B-form DNA. Here we describe a structure prediction protocol tailored to the TAL-DNA system, and report simulation results that shed light on observed repeat-base associations and overall TAL structure. Our models demonstrate that TAL-DNA interactions can be explained by a model in which the TAL repeat domain forms a superhelical repeat structure that wraps around undistorted B-form DNA, paralleling the geometry of the major groove, with contacts between position 13 of each repeat and its associated base pair on the sense strand determining the specificity of DNA recognition. © 2012 The Protein Society.},

abstract={The expressions of chloroplast and mitochondria genes are tightly controlled by numerous nuclear-encoded proteins, mainly at the post-transcriptional level. Recent analyses have identified a large, plant-specific family of pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) motif-containing proteins that are exclusively involved in RNA metabolism of organelle genes via sequence-specific RNA binding. A tandem array of PPR motifs within the protein is believed to facilitate the RNA interaction, although little is known of the mechanism. Here, we describe the RNA interacting framework of a PPR protein, Arabidopsis HCF152. First, we demonstrated that a Pfam model could be relevant to the PPR motif function. A series of proteins with two PPR motifs showed significant differences in their RNA binding affinities, indicating functional differences among PPR motifs. Mutagenesis and informatics analysis putatively identified five amino acids organizing its RNA binding surface [the 1st, 4th, 8th, 12th and 'ii'(-2nd) amino acids] and their complex connections. SELEX (Systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment) and nucleobase preference assays determined the nucleobases with high affinity for HCF152 and suggested several characteristic amino acids that may be involved in determining specificity and/or affinity of the PPR/RNA interaction. © 2011 The Author(s).},

abstract={Nonantibody scaffolds such as designed ankyrin repeat proteins (DARPins) can be rapidly engineered to detect diverse target proteins with high specificity and offer an attractive alternative to antibodies. Using molecular simulations, we predicted that the binding interface between DARPin off7 and its ligand (maltose binding protein; MBP) is characterized by a hot-spot motif in which binding energy is largely concentrated on a few amino acids. To experimentally test this prediction, we fused MBP to a transmembrane domain to properly orient the protein into a polymer-cushioned lipid bilayer, and characterized its interaction with off7 using force spectroscopy. Using this, to our knowledge, novel technique along with surface plasmon resonance, we validated the simulation predictions and characterized the effects of select mutations on the kinetics of the off7-MBP interaction. Our integrated approach offers scientific insights on how the engineered protein interacts with the target molecule. © 2012 Biophysical Society.},

abstract={We present an example-based description of virtual screening (VS) techniques used to identify new regulators of the Akt phosphatase PHLPP (PH domain Leucine repeat Protein Phosphatase). This enzyme opposes the effects of two kinases, Akt and PKC, which play a major role in cell growth and survival. Therefore, PHLPP is a potential therapeutic target in pathophysiologies where these pathways are either repressed, such as in diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, or over-activated as in cancer. To the best of our knowledge, no PHLPP inhibitors have been reported so far in the literature. In this study, we used a combination of chemical and virtual screening techniques that led to the identification of a number of inhibiting compounds with diverse scaffolds. These compounds bind PHLPP and inhibit cell death when tested in cellular assays. We employed GLIDE docking software to screen a library of more than 40,000 compounds selected from the NCI open depository (250,000 compounds) by similarity searches. We compare the efficiency at which we determined binding compounds from the chemical screen, and compare enrichment factors of the virtually discovered compounds over chemical screening. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={Early embryogenesis is the most fundamental developmental process in biology. Screening of ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS)-mutagenized populations of Arabidopsis thaliana led to the identification of a zygote-lethal mutant embryonic factor 19 (fac19) in which embryo development was arrested at the elongated zygote to octant stage. The number of endosperm nuclei decreased significantly in fac19 embryos. Genetic analysis showed fac19 was caused by a single recessive mutation with typical mendelian segregation, suggesting equal maternal and paternal contributions of FAC19 towards zygotic embryogenesis. Positional cloning showed that FAC19 encodes a putative mitochondrial protein with 16 conserved pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) motifs. The fac19 mutation caused a conversion from hydrophilic serine located in a previously unknown domain to hydrophobic leucine. Crosses between FAC19/fac19 and the T-DNA insertion mutants in the same gene failed to complement the fac19 defects, confirming the identity of the gene. This study revealed the critical importance of a PPR protein-mediated mitochondrial function in early embryogenesis. © 2012 Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences.},

abstract={Polyglutamine diseases are a class of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by expansion of polyglutamine repeats, protein aggregation and neuronal cell death in specific regions of the brain. The expansion of a polyglutamine repeat in the TATA binding protein (TBP) causes a neurodegenerative disease, Spinocerebellar Ataxia 17 (SCA17). This disease is characterized by intranuclear protein aggregates and selective loss of cerebellar neurons, including Purkinje cells. MicroRNAs are small, endogenous, regulatory non-coding RNA molecules that bind to mRNAs with partial complementarity and interfere in their expression. Here, we used a cellular model of SCA17 where we expressed TBP with 16 (normal) or 59 (pathogenic) polyglutamines and found differential expression of several microRNAs. Specifically, we found two microRNAs, miR-29a/b, were downregulated. With miR-29a/b downregulation, we found an increased expression of targets of miR-29a/b-β-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA) and BAK, increased cytochrome c release and apoptosis. Restoration of miR-29a/b in the pathogenic polyglutamine background reduced the BACE1 expression. While, antagomiRs against miR-29a/b resulted in an increase in BACE1 levels and neuronal apoptosis. In spite of the elevation of BACE1 in Alzhemiers disease, its role in neuronal cell death has not been established. Here, we show that increased BACE1 expression is not sufficient to cause apoptosis. However restoring level of BACE1 to normal in polyglutamine cells partially reduced neuronal apoptosis. We show a role for the miR-29a/b-BACE1 regulatory interaction in SCA17, suggesting that this microRNA could be part of a common molecular mechanism leading to neuronal cell death in multiple neurodegenerative disorders. The identification of a common mechanism of microRNA mediated neurodegeneration not only improves our understanding of the process, but also provides promising and novel therapeutic targets. © 2012 Landes Bioscience.},

abstract={We applied molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the binding properties of a designed ankyrin repeat protein, the DARPin-CD4 complex. DARPin 23.2 has been reported to disturb the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) viral entry process by Schweizer et al. The protein docking simulation was analysed by comparing the specific ankyrin binder (DARPin 23.2) to an irrelevant control (2JAB) in forming a composite with CD4. To determine the binding free energy of both ankyrins, the MM/PBSA and MM/GBSA protocols were used. The free energy decomposition of both complexes were analysed to explore the role of certain amino acid residues in complex configuration. Interestingly, the molecular docking analysis of DARPin 23.2 revealed a similar CD4 interaction regarding the gp120 theoretical anchoring motif. In contrast, the binding of control ankyrin to CD4 occurred at a different location. This observation suggests that there is an advantage to the molecular modification of DARPin 23.2, an enhanced affinity for CD4. © 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={A considerable number of fungal homologues of human apoptotic genes have been identified in recent years. Nevertheless, we are far from being able to connect the different pieces and construct a primary structure of the fungal apoptotic regulatory network. To get a better picture of the available fungal components, we generated an automatic search protocol that is based on protein sequences together with a domaincentred approach. We used this protocol to search all the available fungal databases for domains and homologues of human apoptotic proteins. Among all known apoptotic domains, only the BIR [baculovirus IAP (inhibitor of apoptosis protein) repeat] domain was found in fungi. A single protein with one or two BIR domains is present in most (but not all) fungal species. We isolated the BIR-containing protein from the grey mould fungus Botrytis cinerea and determined its role in apoptosis and pathogenicity. We also isolated and analysed BcNMA, a homologue of the yeast NMA11 gene. Partial knockout or overexpression strains of BcBIR1 confirmed that BcBir1 is anti-apoptotic and this activity was assigned to the N′-terminal part of the protein. Plant infection assays showed that the fungus undergoes massive PCD (programmed cell death) during early stages of infection. Further studies showed that fungal virulence was fully correlated with the ability of the fungus to cope with plant-induced PCD. Together, our result show that BcBir1 is a major regulator of PCD in B. cinerea and that proper regulation of the host-induced PCD is essential for pathogenesis in this and other similar fungal pathogens. ©The Authors Journal compilation ©2011 Biochemical Society.},

abstract={Background: Human monocytotropic ehrlichiosis is an emerging life-threatening zoonosis caused by obligately intracellular bacterium, Ehrlichia chaffeensis. E. chaffeensis is transmitted by the lone star tick, Amblyomma americanum, and replicates in mononuclear phagocytes in mammalian hosts. Differences in the E. chaffeensis transcriptome in mammalian and arthropod hosts are unknown. Thus, we determined host-specific E. chaffeensis gene expression in human monocyte (THP-1) and in Amblyomma and Ixodes tick cell lines (AAE2 and ISE6) using a whole genome microarray. Methodology/Principal Findings: The majority (~80%) of E. chaffeensis genes were expressed during infection in human and tick cells. There were few differences observed in E. chaffeensis gene expression between the vector Amblyomma and non-vector Ixodes tick cells, but extensive host-specific and differential gene expression profiles were detected between human and tick cells, including higher transcriptional activity in tick cells and identification of gene subsets that were differentially expressed in the two hosts. Differentially and host-specifically expressed ehrlichial genes encoded major immunoreactive tandem repeat proteins (TRP), the outer membrane protein (OMP-1) family, and hypothetical proteins that were 30-80 amino acids in length. Consistent with previous observations, high expression of p28 and OMP-1B genes was detected in human and tick cells, respectively. Notably, E. chaffeensis genes encoding TRP32 and TRP47 were highly upregulated in the human monocytes and expressed as proteins; however, although TRP transcripts were expressed in tick cells, the proteins were not detected in whole cell lysates demonstrating that TRP expression was post transcriptionally regulated. Conclusions/Significance: Ehrlichia gene expression is highly active in tick cells, and differential gene expression among a wide variety of host-pathogen associated genes occurs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that genes associated with host-pathogen interactions are differentially expressed and regulated by post transcriptional mechanisms.},

abstract={Correct specification of the left-right (L-R) axis is important for organ morphogenesis. Conserved mechanisms involving cilia rotation inside node-like structures and asymmetric Nodal signaling in the lateral plate mesoderm (LPM), which are important symmetry-breaking events, have been intensively studied. In zebrafish, the clustering and migration of dorsal forerunner cells (DFCs) is critical for the formation of the Kuppfer's vesicle (KV). However, molecular events underlying DFC clustering and migration are less understood. The WD-repeat proteins function in a variety of biological processes, including cytoskeleton assembly, intracellular trafficking, mRNA splicing, transcriptional regulation and cell migration. However, little is known about the function of WD-repeat proteins in L-R asymmetry determination. Here, we report the identification and functional analyses of zebrafish wdr18, a novel gene that encodes a WD-repeat protein that is highly conserved among vertebrate species. wdr18 was identified from a Tol2 transposon-mediated enhancer trap screen. Follow-up analysis of wdr18 mRNA expression showed that it was detected in DFCs or the KV progenitor cells and later in the KV at early somitogenesis stages. Morpholino knockdown of wdr18 resulted in laterality defects in the visceral organs, which were preceded by the mis-expression of Nodal-related genes, including spaw and pitx2. Examination of morphants at earlier stages revealed that the KV had fewer and shorter cilia which are immotile and a smaller cavity. We further investigated the organization of DFCs in wdr18 morphant embryos using ntl and sox17 as specific markers and found that the clustering and migration of DFC was altered, leading to a disorganized KV. Finally, through a combination of wdr18 and itgb1b morpholino injections, we provided evidence that wdr18 and itgb1b genetically interact in the laterality determination process. Thus, we reveal a new and essential role for WD-repeat proteins in the determination and regulation of L-R asymmetry and propose a potential mechanism for wdr18 in the regulation of DFC clustering and migration and KV formation. © 2011 Gao et al.},

abstract={The will die slowly (wds) gene coding for a WD-repeat protein with seven repeats has been characterized in Drosophila melanogaster. In this paper, the wds gene was isolated and characterized from the Chinese oak silkworm, Antheraea pernyi (Lepidoptera: Saturniidae). The obtained 1733 bp cDNA sequence contains an open reading frame of 1041 bp encoding a polypeptide of 346 amino acids, with 85% sequence identity to that from D. melanogaster. RT-PCR analysis showed that the wds gene was transcribed during four developmental stages and in all the tissues tested, consistent with the result observed in Bombyx mori based on EST resources and genome-wide microarray information. The mRNA expression level of the A. pernyi wds gene was not significantly down- or up- regulated under temperature stress compared to the control, indicating that it may be not involved in temperature stress tolerance. In search of database, the wds protein homologues were found in various kinds of eukaryotes, including fungi, plants, invertebrates and vertebrates, with 50-93% amino acid sequence identities between them, suggesting that they are highly conserved during the evolution of eukaryotes. Phylogenetic analysis based on the wds protein homologue sequences clearly separated the known fungi, plants, invertebrates and vertebrates, consistent with the topology tree on the classical systematics, suggesting the potential value of wds protein in eukaryotic phylogenetic inference. In vertebrates, two apparent types of the wds proteins were also defined by sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2010.},

abstract={Computational prediction of protein functional sites can be a critical first step for analysis of large or complex proteins. Contemporary methods often require several homologous sequences and/or a known protein structure, but these resources are not available for many proteins. Leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) are ligand interaction domains found in numerous proteins across all taxonomic kingdoms, including immune system receptors in plants and animals. We devised Repeat Conservation Mapping (RCM), a computational method that predicts functional sites of LRR domains. RCM utilizes two or more homologous sequences and a generic representation of the LRR structure to identify conserved or diversified patches of amino acids on the predicted surface of the LRR. RCM was validated using solved LRR+ligand structures from multiple taxa, identifying ligand interaction sites. RCM was then used for de novo dissection of two plant microbe-associated molecular pattern (MAMP) receptors, EF-TU RECEPTOR (EFR) and FLAGELLIN-SENSING 2 (FLS2). In vivo testing of Arabidopsis thaliana EFR and FLS2 receptors mutagenized at sites identified by RCM demonstrated previously unknown functional sites. The RCM predictions for EFR, FLS2 and a third plant LRR protein, PGIP, compared favorably to predictions from ODA (optimal docking area), Consurf, and PAML (positive selection) analyses, but RCM also made valid functional site predictions not available from these other bioinformatic approaches. RCM analyses can be conducted with any LRR-containing proteins at www.plantpath.wisc.edu/RCM, and the approach should be modifiable for use with other types of repeat protein domains. © 2011 Helft et al.},

abstract={Using the TrichoEST database, generated in a previous functional genomics project from the beneficial filamentous fungus Trichoderma harzianum, a gene named Thkel1, which codes for a putative kelch-repeat protein, was isolated and characterized. Silencing of this gene in T. harzianum leads to a reduction of glucosidase activity and mycelial growth under abiotic stress conditions. Expression of this gene in Arabidopsis enhances plant tolerance to salt and osmotic stresses, accompanied by an increase in glucosidase activity and a reduction of abscisic acid levels compared to those observed in wild-type plants.

abstract={Isolation and characterization of promoters are important in understanding gene regulation and genetic engineering of crop plants. Earlier, a pentatricopeptide repeat protein (PPR) encoding gene (At2g39230), designated as Lateral Organ Junction (LOJ) gene, was identified through T-DNA promoter trapping in Arabidopsis thaliana. The upstream sequence of the LOJ gene conferred on the reporter gene a novel LOJ-specific expression. The present study was aimed at identifying and characterizing the cis-regulatory motifs responsible for tissue-specific expression in the -673 and +90 bases upstream of the LOJ gene recognized as LOJ promoter. In silico analysis of the LOJ promoter revealed the presence of a few relevant regulatory motifs and a unique feature like AT-rich inverted repeat. Deletion analysis of the LOJ promoter confirmed the presence of an enhancer-like element in the distal region (-673/-214), which stimulates a minimal promoter-like sequence in the -424/-214 region in a position and orientation autonomous manner. The -136/+90 region of the LOJ promoter was efficient in driving reporter gene expression in tissues like developing anthers and seeds of Arabidopsis. A positive regulation for the seed- and anther-specific expression module was contemplated within the 5′ untranslated region of the LOJ gene. However, this function was repressed in the native context by the lateral organ junction-specific expression. The present study has led to the identification of a novel lateral organ junction-specific element and an enhancer sequence in Arabidopsis with potential applications in plant genetic engineering. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={The genes coding for PGYRPs (proline-, glycine-and tyrosine-rich proteins) are widely distributed across eukaryotes and have been proposed to have critical role in plant development, especially in response to environmental stresses. In this study, total of 12 soybean PGYRPs (GmPGYRP1-12) were identified from the soybean genome database for the first time and full-length cDNA and DNA sequences of GmPGYRP7 was cloned. GmPGYRP1-12 genes encoded a set of small predicted proteins (<120 aa) with molecular mass of 7.20-13.29 kDa and isoelectric point of 4.06-6.57. All GmPGYRPs contained three exons and two introns with fixed occurring sites within genomic DNA sequences. In the putative GmPGYRP sequences, 4 amino acids (proline, glycine, tyrosine, and glutamine) account for more than 39% of the total protein composition. GmPGYRPs had a relatively flexible GYPPX motif followed by a highly conserved cysteine-rich domain (GCLAAXCCCCXLXC) and showed high similarity to other known PGYRPs, especially in C-terminal region. Most of PGYRPs can be divided into five subgroups according to phylogenetic analysis. The transcripts of GmPGYRP1, 3, 5, and 7, representing different PGYRP subgroups, appeared in different organs including seedling leaves, stems, roots, flowers, and developing seeds, but mainly accumulated in seedling roots. Furthermore, the expression of GmPGYRP1, 3, 5, and 7 was significantly regulated by drought, salt and cold, but obviously repressed by abscisic acid (ABA) at early stage. Our data suggest that GmPGYRP genes encoding a class of conservative XYPPX-repeat proteins probably play an important role in plant development as well as in response to abiotic stresses. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2010.},

abstract={The cellular response to the Drosophila BMP 2/4-like ligand Decapentaplegic (DPP) serves as one of the best-studied models for understanding the long-range control of tissue growth and pattern formation during animal development. Nevertheless, fundamental questions remain unanswered regarding extracellular regulation of the ligand itself, as well as the nature of the downstream transcriptional response to BMP pathway activation. Here, we report the identification of larval translucida (ltl), a novel target of BMP activity in Drosophila. Both gain- and loss-of-function analyses implicate LTL, a leucine-rich repeat protein, in the regulation of wing growth and vein patterning. At the molecular level, we demonstrate that LTL is a secreted protein that antagonizes BMP-dependent MAD phosphorylation, indicating that it regulates DPP/BMP signaling at or above the level of ligand-receptor interactions. Furthermore, based on genetic interactions with the DPP-binding protein Crossveinless 2 and biochemical interactions with the glypican Dally-like, we propose that LTL acts in the extracellular space where it completes a novel auto-regulatory loop that modulates BMP activity.},

abstract={Chondroadherin is a leucine-rich repeat protein known to mediate adhesion of isolated cells via the integrin α2β1 and to interact with collagen. In this work, we show that cell adhesion to chondroadherin leads to activation of MAPKs but does not result in cell spreading and division. This is in contrast to the spreading and dividing of cells grown on collagen, although the binding is mediated via the same α2β1 receptor. We identified a cell binding motif, CQLRGLRRWLEAK318 by mass spectrometry after protease digestion of chondroadherin. Cells adhering to the synthetic peptide CQLRGLRRWLEAK 318 remained round, as was observed when they bound to the intact protein. The peptide added in solution was able to inhibit cell adhesion to the intact protein in a dose-dependent manner and was also verified to bind to the α2β1 integrin. A cyclic peptide, CQLRGLRRWLEAKASRPDATC326, mimicking the structural constraints of this sequence in the intact protein, showed similar efficiency in inhibiting binding to chondroadherin. The unique peptide motif responsible for cellular binding is primarily located in the octamer sequence LRRWLEAK318. Binding of cells to the active peptide or to chondroadherin immobilized on cell culture plates rapidly induces intracellular signaling (i.e. ERK phosphorylation). Thus, chondroadherin interaction with cells may be central for maintaining the adult chondrocyte phenotype and cartilage homeostasis. The peptides, particularly the more stable cyclic peptide, open new opportunities to modulate cell behavior in situations of tissue pathology. © 2011 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

abstract={We describe here the diversity of chloroplast proteins required for embryo development in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Interfering with certain chloroplast functions has long been known to result in embryo lethality. What has not been reported before is a comprehensive screen for embryo-defective (emb) mutants altered in chloroplast proteins. From a collection of transposon and T-DNA insertion lines at the RIKEN chloroplast function database (http://rarge.psc.riken.jp/chloroplast/) that initially appeared to lack homozygotes and segregate for defective seeds, we identified 23 additional examples of EMB genes that likely encode chloroplast-localized proteins. Fourteen gene identities were confirmed with allelism tests involving duplicate mutant alleles. We then queried journal publications and the Seed Genes database (www.seedgenes.org) to establish a comprehensive dataset of 381 nuclear genes encoding chloroplast proteins of Arabidopsis associated with embryo-defective (119 genes), plant pigment (121 genes), gametophyte (three genes), and alternate (138 genes) phenotypes. Loci were ranked based on the level of certainty that the gene responsible for the phenotype had been identified and the protein product localized to chloroplasts. Embryo development is frequently arrested when amino acid, vitamin, or nucleotide biosynthesis is disrupted but proceeds when photosynthesis is compromised and when levels of chlorophyll, carotenoids, or terpenoids are reduced. Chloroplast translation is also required for embryo development, with genes encoding chloroplast ribosomal and pentatricopeptide repeat proteins well represented among EMB datasets. The chloroplast accD locus, which is necessary for fatty acid biosynthesis, is essential in Arabidopsis but not in Brassica napus or maize (Zea mays), where duplicated nuclear genes compensate for its absence or loss of function. © 2010 American Society of Plant Biologists.},

abstract={Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus are small, vibroid, predatory bacteria that grow within the periplasmic space of a host Gram-negative bacterium. The intermediate-filament (IF)-like protein crescentin is a member of a broad class of IF-like, coiled-coil-repeat-proteins (CCRPs), discovered in Caulobacter crescentus, where it contributes to the vibroid cell shape. The B. bacteriovorus genome has a single ccrp gene encoding a protein with an unusually long, stutter-free, coiled-coil prediction; the inactivation of this did not alter the vibriod cell shape, but caused cell deformations, visualized as chiselled insets or dents, near the cell poles and a general 'creased' appearance, under the negative staining preparation used for electron microscopy, but not in unstained, frozen, hydrated cells. Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus expressing 'teal' fluorescent protein (mTFP), as a C-terminal tag on the wild-type Ccrp protein, did not deform under negative staining, suggesting that the function was not impaired. Localization of fluorescent Ccrp-mTFP showed some bias to the cell poles, independent of the cytoskeleton, as demonstrated by the addition of the MreB-specific inhibitor A22. We suggest that the Ccrp protein in B. bacteriovorus contributes as an underlying scaffold, similar to that described for the CCRP protein FilP in Streptomyces coelicolor, preventing cellular indentation, but not contributing to the vibroid shape of the B. bacteriovorus cells. © 2010 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

abstract={In vascular plants, organelle RNAs are edited by C-to-U base modification. Hundreds of mitochondrial C residues are targeted for editing in flowering plants. In this study, we exploited naturally occurring variation in editing extent to identify Required for Efficiency of Mitochondrial Editing1 (REME1), an Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) pentatricopeptide repeat protein-encoding gene belonging to the DYW subclass that promotes editing of at least two C residues on different mitochondrial transcripts. Positional cloning identified REME1 unambiguously as the gene controlling editing of nad2-558. Virus-induced gene silencing of REME1 confirmed its role in editing of nad2-558 and allowed us to identify orfX-552 as a second C whose editing is positively controlled by REME1. An unexpected outcome of REME1 silencing was the finding of a number of mitochondrial C targets whose editing extent exhibits a significant and reproducible increase in silenced tissues. That increase was shown to be partly due to the virus inoculation and partly to REME1-specific silencing. Analysis of an insertional T-DNA mutant within the REME1 coding sequence confirmed the findings of the virus-induced gene silencing experiments: decrease in editing extent of nad2-558 and orfX-552 and increase in editing extent of two sites, matR-1771 and rpl5-92. Transgenic complementation of the low-edited accession (Landsberg erecta) restored the editing of nad2-558 and orfX-552 to high-edited accession (Columbia)-type levels or to even higher levels than Columbia. There was no effect of the transgene on editing extent of matR-1771 and rpl5-92. The strategy and tools used in this report can be applied to identify additional genes that affect editing extent in plant mitochondria.},

abstract={Extracellular interactions involving both secreted and membrane-tethered receptor proteins are essential to initiate signaling pathways that orchestrate cellular behaviors within biological systems. Because of the biochemical properties of these proteins and their interactions, identifying novel extracellular interactions remains experimentally challenging. To address this, we have recently developed an assay, AVEXIS (avidity-based extracellular interaction screen) to detect low affinity extracellular interactions on a large scale and have begun to construct interaction networks between zebrafish receptors belonging to the immunoglobulin and leucine-rich repeat protein families to identify novel signaling pathways important for early development. Here, we expanded our zebrafish protein library to include other domain families and many more secreted proteins and performed our largest screen to date totaling 16,544 potential unique interactions. We report 111 interactions of which 96 are novel and include the first documented extracellular ligands for 15 proteins. By including 77 interactions from previous screens, we assembled an expanded network of 188 extracellular interactions between 92 proteins and used it to show that secreted proteins have twice as many interaction partners as membrane-tethered receptors and that the connectivity of the extracellular network behaves as a power law. To try to understand the functional role of these interactions, we determined new expression patterns for 164 genes within our clone library by using whole embryo in situ hybridization at five key stages of zebrafish embryonic development. These expression data were integrated with the binding network to reveal where each interaction was likely to function within the embryo and were used to resolve the static interaction network into dynamic tissue- and stage-specific subnetworks within the developing zebrafish embryo. All these data were organized into a freely accessible on-line database called ARNIE (AVEXIS Receptor Network with Integrated Expression; www.sanger.ac.uk/arnie) and provide a valuable resource of new extracellular signaling interactions for developmental biology. © 2010 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

abstract={Pur-α is a nucleic acid-binding protein involved in cell cycle control, transcription, and neuronal function. Initially no prediction of the three-dimensional structure of Pur-α was possible. However, recently we solved the X-ray structure of Pura from the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster and showed that it contains a so-called PUR domain. Here we explain how we exploited bioinformatics tools in combination with X-ray structure determination of a bacterial homolog to obtain diffracting crystals and the high-resolution structure of Drosophila Pur-α. First, we used sensitive methods for remotehomology detection to find three repetitive regions in Pur-a. We realized that our lack of understanding how these repeats interact to form a globular domain was a major problem for crystallization and structure determination. With our information on the repeat motifs we then identified a distant bacterial homolog that contains only one repeat. We determined the bacterial crystal structure and found that two of the repeats interact to form a globular domain. Based on this bacterial structure, we calculated a computational model of the eukaryotic protein. The model allowed us to design a crystallizable fragment and to determine the structure of Drosophila Pur-α. Key for success was the fact that single repeats of the bacterial protein self-assembled into a globular domain, instructing us on the number and boundaries of repeats to be included for crystallization trials with the eukaryotic protein. This study demonstrates that the simpler structural domain arrangement of a distant prokaryotic protein can guide the design of eukaryotic crystallization constructs. Since many eukaryotic proteins contain multiple repeats or repeating domains, this approach might be instructive for structural studies of a range of proteins. © 2010 Graebsch et al.},

abstract={The essential eukaryotic molecular chaperone Hsp90 operates with the help of different co-chaperones, which regulate its ATPase activity and serve as adaptors to recruit client proteins and other molecular chaperones, such as Hsp70, to the Hsp90 complex. Several Hsp90 and Hsp70 co-chaperones contain the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain, which interacts with the highly conserved EEVD motif at the C-terminal ends of Hsp90 and Hsp70. The acidic side chains in EEVD interact with a subset of basic residues in the TPR binding pocket called a 'carboxylate clamp'. Since the carboxylate clamp residues are conserved in the TPR domains of known Hsp90/Hsp70 co-chaperones, we carried out an in silico search for TPR proteins in Arabidopsis and rice comprising of at least one three-motif TPR domain with conserved amino acid residues required for Hsp90/Hsp70 binding. This approach identified in Arabidopsis a total of 36 carboxylate clamp (CC)-TPR proteins, including 24 novel proteins, with potential to interact with Hsp90/Hsp70. The newly identified CC-TPR proteins in Arabidopsis and rice contain additional protein domains such as ankyrin, SET, octicosapeptide/Phox/Bem1p (Phox/PB1), DnaJ-like, thioredoxin, FBD and F-box, and protein kinase and U-box, indicating varied functions for these proteins. To provide proof-of-concept of the newly identified CC-TPR proteins for interaction with Hsp90, we demonstrated interaction of AtTPR1 and AtTPR2 with AtHsp90 in yeast two-hybrid and in vitro pull down assays. These findings indicate that the in silico approach used here successfully identified in a genome-wide context CC-TPR proteins with potential to interact with Hsp90/Hsp70, and further suggest that the Hsp90/Hsp70 system relies on TPR co-chaperones more than it was previously realized. © 2010 Prasad et al.},

abstract={Splicing of plant organellar transcripts is facilitated by members of a large protein family, the pentatricopeptide repeat proteins. We have identified a pentatricopeptide repeat protein in a genetic screen for mutants resistant to inhibition of root growth by buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), an inhibitor of glutathione synthesis and consequently named BIR6 (BSO-insensitive roots 6). BIR6 is involved in splicing of intron 1 of the mitochondrial nad7 transcript. Loss-of-function mutations in BIR6 result in a strongly reduced accumulation of fully processed nad7 transcript. This affects assembly of Complex I and results in moderate growth retardation. In agreement with disruption of Complex I function, the genes encoding alternative NADH oxidizing enzymes are induced in the mutant, and the mutant plants are less sensitive to mannitol and salt stress. Mutation in the BIR6 gene allowed normal root growth in presence of BSO and strongly attenuated depletion of glutathione content at these conditions. The same phenotype was observed with other mutants affected in function of Complex I, thus reinforcing the importance of Complex I function for cellular redox homeostasis. © 2010 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

abstract={PH domain Leucine-rich repeat protein phosphatase (PHLPP) directly dephosphorylates and inactivates Akt and protein kinase C, poising it as a prime target for pharmacological intervention of two major survival pathways. Here we report on the discovery of small molecule inhibitors of the phosphatase activity of PHLPP, a member of the PP2C family of phosphatases for which there are no general pharmacological inhibitors. First, the Diversity Set of the NCI was screened for inhibition of the purified phosphatase domain of PHLPP2 in vitro. Second, selected libraries from the open NCI database were docked into a virtual model of the phosphatase domain of PHLPP2, previously trained with our experimental data set, unveiling additional inhibitors. Biochemical and cellular assays resulted in the identification of two structurally diverse compounds that selectively inhibit PHLPP in vitro, increase Akt signaling in cells, and prevent apoptosis. Thus, chemical and virtual screening has resulted in the identification of small molecules that promote Akt signaling by inhibiting its negative regulator PHLPP. © 2010 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Ecm29 is a 200-kDa HEAT repeat protein that binds the 26 S proteasome. Genome-wide two-hybrid screens and mass spectrometry have identified molecular motors, endosomal components, and ubiquitin-proteasome factors as Ecm29-interacting proteins. The C-terminal half of human Ecm29 binds myosins and kinesins; its N-terminal region binds the endocytic proteins, Vps11, Rab11-FIP4, and rabaptin. Whereas full-length FLAGEcm29, its C-terminal half, and a small central fragment of Ecm29 remain bound to glycerol-gradient- separated 26 S proteasomes, the N-terminal half of Ecm29 does not. Confocal microscopy showed that Ecm-26 S proteasomes are present on flotillin-positive endosomes, but they are virtually absent from caveolin- and clathrin-decorated endosomes. Expression of the small central fragment of Ecm29 markedly reduces proteasome association with flotillin-positive endosomes. Identification of regions within Ecm29 capable of binding molecular motors, endosomal proteins, and the 26 S proteasome supports the hypothesis that Ecm29 serves as an adaptor for coupling 26 S proteasomes to specific cellular compartments. © 2010 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

abstract={Ubiquitination and deubiquitination are reciprocal processes that tune protein stability, function, and/or localization. The removal of ubiquitin and remodeling of ubiquitin chains is catalyzed by deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), which are cysteine proteases or metalloproteases. Although ubiquitination has been extensively studied for decades, the complexity of cellular roles for deubiquitinating enzymes has only recently been explored, and there are still several gaps in our understanding of when, where, and how these enzymes function to modulate the fate of polypeptides. To address these questions we performed a systematic analysis of the 20 Schizosaccharomyces pombe DUBs using confocal microscopy, proteomics, and enzymatic activity assays. Our results reveal that S. pombe DUBs are present in almost all cell compartments, and the majority are part of stable protein complexes essential for their function. Interestingly, DUB partners identified by our study include the homolog of a putative tumor suppressor gene not previously linked to the ubiquitin pathway, and two conserved tryptophan-aspartate (WD) repeat proteins that regulate Ubp9, a DUB that we show participates in endocytosis, actin dynamics, and cell polarity. In order to understand how DUB activity affects these processes we constructed multiple DUB mutants and find that a quintuple deletion of ubp4 ubp5 ubp9 ubp15 sst2/amsh displays severe growth, polarity, and endocytosis defects. This mutant allowed the identification of two common substrates for five cytoplasmic DUBs. Through these studies, a common regulatory theme emerged in which DUB localization and/or activity is modulated by interacting partners. Despite apparently distinct cytoplasmic localization patterns, several DUBs cooperate in regulating endocytosis and cell polarity. These studies provide a framework for dissecting DUB signaling pathways in S. pombe and may shed light on DUB functions in metazoans. 2010 Kouranti et al.},

abstract={Background: Intragenic tandem repeats occur throughout all domains of life and impart functional and structural variability to diverse translation products. Repeat proteins confer distinctive surface phenotypes to many unicellular organisms, including those with minimal genomes such as the wall-less bacterial monoderms, Mollicutes. One such repeat pattern in this clade is distributed in a manner suggesting its exchange by horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Expanding genome sequence databases reveal the pattern in a widening range of bacteria, and recently among eucaryotic microbes. We examined the genomic flux and consequences of the motif by determining its distribution, predicted structural features and association with membrane-targeted proteins.Results: Using a refined hidden Markov model, we document a 25-residue protein sequence motif tandemly arrayed in variable-number repeats in ORFs lacking assigned functions. It appears sporadically in unicellular microbes from disparate bacterial and eucaryotic clades, representing diverse lifestyles and ecological niches that include host parasitic, marine and extreme environments. Tracts of the repeats predict a malleable configuration of recurring domains, with conserved hydrophobic residues forming an amphipathic secondary structure in which hydrophilic residues endow extensive sequence variation. Many ORFs with these domains also have membrane-targeting sequences that predict assorted topologies; others may comprise reservoirs of sequence variants. We demonstrate expressed variants among surface lipoproteins that distinguish closely related animal pathogens belonging to a subgroup of the Mollicutes. DNA sequences encoding the tandem domains display dyad symmetry. Moreover, in some taxa the domains occur in ORFs selectively associated with mobile elements. These features, a punctate phylogenetic distribution, and different patterns of dispersal in genomes of related taxa, suggest that the repeat may be disseminated by HGT and intra-genomic shuffling.Conclusions: We describe novel features of PARCELs (Palindromic Amphipathic Repeat Coding ELements), a set of widely distributed repeat protein domains and coding sequences that were likely acquired through HGT by diverse unicellular microbes, further mobilized and diversified within genomes, and co-opted for expression in the membrane proteome of some taxa. Disseminated by multiple gene-centric vehicles, ORFs harboring these elements enhance accessory gene pools as part of the "mobilome" connecting genomes of various clades, in taxa sharing common niches. © 2010 Röske et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) are a rich source of information for gene discovery. In this paper, we describe the annotation of ESTs of Phytophthora capsici whose complete genome is not yet available. P. capsici is an Oomycete plant pathogen capable of infecting wide range of plants including cucumber, squash, melons, pumpkin, pepper, tomato and eggplant. In India it causes severe economic losses in black pepper, chillies and cocoa. Towards the understanding of gene function in P. capsici, we undertook the functional annotation of ESTs available at NCBI. A total of 56,457 ESTs were downloaded from NCBI and assembled into 5966 contigs. Functional categorization of these ESTs was performed using database similarity search. By functional analysis, we estimated that 84.73% of transcripts encode significant proteins. The most prominent sequences corresponds to members of metabolic pathways, avirulence-associated protein, beta-tubulin, calcium/calmodulin dependent protein kinase 3, catalase, endo-1, 4-betaglucanase, cyst germination specific acidic repeat protein precursor, elicitin-like protein, glucanase inhibitor protein, heat shock protein, Kazal-like serine protease inhibitor, mitogen-activated protein kinase, ribosomal protein, serine/threonine kinase, syntaxin and ubiquitin.

abstract={Plant innate immunity is mediated in part by resistance (R) proteins that detect pathogens and mount a robust defense response to fight against infection. We previously characterized proteins in the MOS4-associated complex (MAC) that function in the regulation of plant immune responses downstream of the autoactivated R protein snc1. The MAC is a highly conserved spliceosome- associated complex homologous to the nineteen complex (NTC) in yeast and human. The availability of proteomics data sets in these organisms allowed us to systematically test the biological function of additional putative MAC proteins based on protein sequence homology and reverse genetics. In this study, we investigate the function of the GENERAL CONTROL NONDEREPRESSIBLE1 (GCN1) homolog in Arabidopsis. GCN1 was previously isolated as a novel component of the NTC in one proteomics study of the human spliceosome. We identified a single GCN1 homolog in Arabidopsis and partially characterized its function using available T-DNA insertion mutants. This locus, previously named ILITYHIA (ILA), is required for non-host and basal resistance against Pseudomonas syringae as well as resistance conditioned by specific nucleotide binding, leucine-rich repeat (NB-LRR) R proteins. Furthermore, ILA is required for systemic acquired resistance (SAR). Previous proteomic identification of MAC components in Arabidopsis did not identify ILA, and epistasis analysis between snc1 and ila revealed that ILA does not function in snc1-mediated resistance. Overall, our results show that ILA functions in immunity against bacterial infection. © 2010 The Author.},

abstract={Background. RNA-binding proteins of the PUF family share a conserved domain consisting of tandemly repeated 36-40 amino acid motifs (typically eight) known as Puf repeats. Proteins containing tandem repeats are often dominant targets of humoral responses during infectious diseases. Thus, we considered of interest to analyze whether Leishmania PUF proteins result antigenic during visceral leishmaniasis (VL). Findings. Here, employing whole-genome databases, we report the composition, and structural features, of the PUF family in Leishmania infantum. Additionally, the 10 genes of the L. infantum PUF family were cloned and used to express the Leishmania PUFs in bacteria as recombinant proteins. Finally, the antigenicity of these PUF proteins was evaluated by determining levels of specific antibodies in sera from experimentally infected hamsters. The Leishmania PUFs were all recognized by the sera, even though with different degree of reactivity and/or frequency of recognition. The reactivity of hamster sera against recombinant LiPUF1 and LiPUF2 was particularly prominent, and these proteins were subsequently assayed against sera from human patients. High antibody responses against rLiPUF1 and rLiPUF2 were found in sera from VL patients, but these proteins resulted also recognized by sera from Chagas' disease patients. Conclusion. Our results suggest that Leishmania PUFs are targets of the humoral response during L. infantum infection and may represent candidates for serodiagnosis and/or vaccine reagents; however, it should be kept in mind the cross-reactivity of LiPUFs with antibodies induced against other trypanosomatids such as Trypanosoma cruzi. © 2010 Requena et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={(Graph Presented) A biased-potential molecular dynamics simulation method, accelerated molecular dynamics (AMD), was combined with the chemical shift prediction algorithm SHIFTX to calculate 1HN, 15N, 13Cα, 13Cβ, and 13C′ chemical shifts of the ankyrin repeat protein IκBα (residues 67-206), the primary inhibitor of nuclear factor κ-B (NF-κB). Free-energy-weighted molecular ensembles were generated over a range of acceleration levels, affording systematic enhancement of the conformational space sampling of the protein. We have found that the predicted chemical shifts, particularly for the 15N, 13Cα, and 13Cβ nuclei, improve substantially with enhanced conformational space sampling up to an optimal acceleration level. Significant improvement in the predicted chemical shift data coincides with those regions of the protein that exhibit backbone dynamics on longer time scales. Interestingly, the optimal acceleration level for reproduction of the chemical shift data has previously been shown to best reproduce the experimental residual dipolar coupling (RDC) data for this system, as both chemical shift data and RDCs report on an ensemble and time average in the millisecond range.

abstract={The pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) protein family is one of the largest and most complex families in plants. These proteins contain multiple 35-amino acid repeats that are proposed to form a super helix capable of binding RNA. PPR proteins have been implicated in many crucial functions broadly involving organelle biogenesis and plant development. In this study, we identified many genes encoding PPR protein in Upland cotton through an extensive survey of the database of Gossypium hirsutum. Furthermore, we isolated five full-length cDNA of PPR genes from G. hirsutum 0-613-2R which were named GhPPR1-GhPPR5. Domain analysis revealed that the deduced amino acid sequences of GhPPR1-5 contained from 5 to 10 PPR motifs and those PPR proteins were divided into two different PPR subfamilies. GhPPR1-2 belonged to the PLS subfamily and GhPPR3-5 belonged to the P subfamily. Phylogenetic analysis of the five GhPPR proteins and 18 other plant PPR proteins also revealed that the same subfamily clustered together. All five GhPPR genes were differentially but constitutively expressed in roots, stems, leaves, pollens, and fibers based on the gene expression analysis by real-time quantitative RT-PCR.

abstract={In mitochondria of higher plants, the majority of 5′ termini of mature mRNAs are generated posttranscriptionally. To gain insight into this process, we analyzed a natural 5′ end polymorphism in the species Arabidopsis thaliana. This genetic approach identified the nuclear gene At1g62670, encoding a pentatricopeptide repeat protein. The functional importance of this mitochondrial restorer of fertility-like protein, designated RNA PROCESSING FACTOR2 (RPF2), is confirmed by the analysis of a respective T-DNA knockout mutant and its functional restoration by in vivo complementation. RPF2 fulfills two functions: it is required for the generation of a distinct 5′ terminus of transcripts of subunit 9 of the NADH DEHYDROGENASE complex (nad9) and it determines the efficiency of 5′ end formation of the mRNAs for subunit 3 of the CYTOCHROME C OXIDASE (cox3), the latter also being influenced by mitochondrial DNA sequences. Accordingly, recombinant RPF2 protein directly binds to a nad9 mRNA fragment in vitro. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and immunodetection analyses reveal that altered 5′ processing does not influence accumulation of the nad9 and cox3 polypeptides. In accessions C24, Oystese-1, and Yosemite-0, different inactive RPF2 alleles exist, demonstrating the variability of this gene in Arabidopsis. The identification of RPF2 is a major step toward the characterization of 5′ mRNA processing in mitochondria of higher plants. © 2010 American Society of Plant Biologists.},

abstract={The centrosome functions as the microtubule-organizing center and plays a vital role in organizing spindle poles during mitosis. Recently, we identified a centrosomal protein called CLERC (Centrosomal leucine-rich repeat and coiled-coil containing protein) which is a human ortholog of Chlamydomonas Vfl1 protein. The bibliography as well as database searches provided evidence that the human proteome contains at least seven centrosomal leucine-rich repeat proteins including CLERC. CLERC and four other centrosomal leucine-rich repeat proteins contain the SDS22-like leucine-rich repeat motifs, whereas the remaining two proteins contain the RI-like and the cysteine-containing leucine-rich repeat motifs. Individual leucine-rich repeat motifs are highly conserved and present in evolutionarily diverse organisms. Here, we provide an overview of CLERC and other centrosomal leucine-rich repeat proteins, their structures, their evolutionary relationships, and their functional properties. © Versita Warsaw and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Pathogenic micro-organisms have been suggested to vary the number of intragenic repeats present within secreted or cell membrane/cell wall-associated proteins in order to manipulate host immune responses. We have identified a number of genes predicted to encode secreted proteins possessing internal tandem repeats in the genome sequence of Mycosphaerella graminicola (isolate IPO323), a wheat leaf-specific fungal pathogen and causal agent of Septoria tritici blotch disease. Twenty-three M. graminicola Tandem Repeat Proteins (MgTRPs) were subject to further analysis. Many MgTRPs varied in the number of intragenic repeats between isolates and almost all were expressed. Peak gene expression was frequently observed towards the end of the symptomless phase of wheat leaf colonisation which typically lasts for 8-10 days after inoculation. In contrast, with one exception, increased expression of the majority of MgTRPs was not detected during interactions with resistant host genotypes. Repeat number differences detected in genomic DNA were retained in different transcript sizes produced during plant infection by different isolates. One in planta expressed MgTRP was found to reside within a ∼6 kb region that appears to be absent from a number of tested isolates and also from individual members of a modern field population. Sequence analysis of another in planta expressed MgTRP from six isolates highlighted the potential for structural changes which may occur as a consequence of varying internal repeat numbers and provided support for repeat variation occurring as a consequence of intragenic recombination. These data provide new insights into the genetic variation which exists within M. graminicola populations at the level of in planta expressed secreted/surface-associated proteins which are candidate effectors in the host-pathogen interaction. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={We report the nucleotide sequence of two novel cryptic plasmids (4357 and 14 662 base pairs) carried by a Yersinia enterocolitica biotype 1A strain isolated from pork. As distinguished from most biotype 1A strains, this isolate, designated 07-04449, exhibited adherence to eukaryotic cells. The smaller plasmid pYe4449-1 carries five attributable open reading frames (ORFs) encoding the first CcdA/CcdB-like antitoxin/toxin system described for a Yersinia plasmid, a RepA-like replication initiation protein, and mobilizing factors MobA and MobC. The deduced amino acid sequences showed highest similarity to proteins described in Salmonella (CcdA/B), Klebsiella (RepA), and Plesiomonas (MobA/C) indicating genomic fluidity among members of the Enterobacteriaceae. One additional ORF with unknown function, termed ORF5, was identified with an ancestry distinct from the rest of the plasmid. While the C+G content of ORF5 is 38.3%, the rest of pYe4449-1 shows a C+G content of 55.7%. The C+G content of the larger plasmid pYe4449-2 (54.9%) was similar to that of pYe4449-1 (53.7%) and differed from that of the Y. enterocolitica genome (47.3%). Of the 14 ORFs identified on pYe4449-2, only six ORFs showed significant similarity to database entries. For three of these ORFs likely functions could be ascribed: a TnpR-like resolvase and a phage replication protein, localized each on a low C+G island, and DNA primase TraC. Two ORFs of pYe4449-2, ORF3 and ORF7, seem to encode secretable proteins. Epitope-tagging of ORF3 revealed protein expression at 4°C but not at or above 27°C suggesting adaptation to a habitat outside swine. The hypothetical protein encoded by ORF7 is the member of a novel repeat protein family sharing the DxxGN(x)n DxxGN motif. Our findings illustrate the exceptional gene pool diversity within the species Y. enterocolitica driven by horizontal gene transfer events. Copyright © 2009 Daniela Lepka et al.},

abstract={Safe recombinant vaccines, based on a small number of antigenic proteins, are emerging as the most attractive, cost-effective solution against infectious diseases. In the present work, we confirmed previous data from our laboratory showing that whole viable bacterial cell treatment with proteases followed by the identification of released peptides by mass spectrometry is the method of choice for the rapid and reliable identification of vaccine candidates in Gram-positive bacteria. When applied to the Group B Streptococcus COH1 strain, 43 surface-associated proteins were identified, including all the protective antigens described in the literature as well as a new protective antigen, the cell wall-anchored protein SAN-1485 belonging to the serine-rich repeat protein family. This strategy overcomes the difficulties so far encountered in the identification of novel vaccine candidates and speeds up the entire vaccine discovery process by reducing the number of recombinant proteins to be tested in the animal model. © 2009 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

abstract={Here we apply the graph-theoretic concept of Betweenness centrality to a class of protein repeats, e.g., Armadillo (ARM) and HEAT. The Betweenness of a node represents how often a node is traversed on the shortest path between all pairs of nodes i, j in the network and thus gives the contribution of each node in the network. These repeats are not easily detectable at the sequence level because of low conservation between independent repeated units, e.g., HEAT repeats are known to have less than 13% identity. Their identification at the structure level typically involves self structure-structure comparison, which can be computationally very intensive. Our analysis of a set of proteins from ARM and HEAT repeat family shows that the repeat regions exhibit similar connectivity patterns for the repeating units. Since it is generally accepted that in many networks, the larger the degree of a node, the larger the chance that many of the shortest paths will pass through this node, computing vertex Betweenness provides a simple and elegant approach for identifying tandem structural repeats in proteins. ©2009 IEEE.},

In mitosis, the metaphase to anaphase transition is governed by an E3 ubiquitin ligase called the cyclosome or Anaphase-Promoting Complex (APC), and a WD40-repeat protein co-factor called Cdc20. In vitro Cdc20-dependent APC (APC Cdc20) assays have been useful in the identification and validation of target substrates, and in the study of APC enzymology and regulation. Many aspects of the regulation of cell cycle progression have been discovered in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and proteins purified from this model organism have been employed in a wide variety of in vitro assays. Here we outline a quantitative in vitro mitotic APC Cdc20 assay that makes use of a highly active form of the APC that is purified from budding yeast cells arrested in mitosis. © 2009 Humana Press, a part of Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={Background. We have previously identified endonuclein as a cell cycle regulated WD-repeat protein that is up-regulated in adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. Now, we aim to investigate its biomedical functions. Results. Using the cDNA encoding human endonuclein, we have expressed and purified the recombinant protein from Escherichia coli using metal affinity chromatography. The recombinant protein was immobilized to a column and by affinity chromatography several interacting proteins were purified from several litres of placenta tissue extract. After chromatography the eluted proteins were further separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and identified by tandem mass spectrometry. The interacting proteins were identified as; Tax interaction protein 1 (TIP-1), A fibrinogen transcription factor (P16/SSBP1), immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein (BiP), human ER-associated DNAJ (HEDJ/DNAJB11), endonuclein interaction protein 8 (EIP-8), and pregnancy specific -1 glycoproteins (PSGs). Surface plasmon resonance analysis and confocal fluorescence microscopy were used to further characterize the interactions. Conclusions. Our results demonstrate that endonuclein interacts with several proteins indicating a broad function including signal transduction and chaperone activity. © 2009 Ludvigsen et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={Leucine-rich repeat (LRR) proteins form a large and diverse family. They have a wide range of functions most of which involve the formation of protein-protein interactions. All known LRR structures form curved solenoids, although there is large variation in their curvature. It is this curvature that determines the shape and dimensions of the inner space available for ligand binding. Unfortunately, large-scale parameters such as the overall curvature of a protein domain are extremely difficult to predict. Here, we present a quantitative analysis of determinants of curvature of this family. Individual repeats typically range in length between 20 and 30 residues and have a variety of secondary structures on their convex side. The observed curvature of the LRR domains correlates poorly with the lengths of their individual repeats. We have, therefore, developed a scoring function based on the secondary structure of the convex side of the protein that allows prediction of the overall curvature with a high degree of accuracy. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of this method in selecting a suitable template for comparative modeling. We have developed an automated, quantitative protocol that can be used to predict accurately the curvature of leucine-rich repeat proteins of unknown structure from sequence alone.

abstract={Motivation: Over the last years a number of evidences have been accumulated about high incidence of tandem repeats in proteins carrying fundamental biological functions and being related to a number of human diseases. At the same time, frequently, protein repeats are strongly degenerated during evolution and, therefore, cannot be easily identified. To solve this problem, several computer programs which were based on different algorithms have been developed. Nevertheless, our tests showed that there is still room for improvement of methods for accurate and rapid detection of tandem repeats in proteins. Results: We developed a new program called T-REKS for ab initio identification of the tandem repeats. It is based on clustering of lengths between identical short strings by using a K-means algorithm. Benchmark of the existing programs and T-REKS on several sequence datasets is presented. Our program being linked to the Protein Repeat DataBase opens the way for large-scale analysis of protein tandem repeats. T-REKS can also be applied to the nucleotide sequences. © The Author 2009.

abstract={A highly evolved surveillance system in plants is able to detect a broad range of signals originating from pathogens, damaged tissues, or altered developmental processes, initiating sophisticated molecular mechanisms that result in defence, wound healing, and development. Microbe-associated molecular pattern molecules (MAMPs), damage-associated molecular pattern molecules (DAMPs), virulence factors, secreted proteins, and processed peptides can be recognized directly or indirectly by this surveillance system. Nucleotide binding-leucine rich repeat proteins (NB-LRR) are intracellular receptors and have been targeted by breeders for decades to elicit resistance to crop pathogens in the field. Receptor-like kinases (RLKs) or receptor like proteins (RLPs) are membrane bound signalling molecules with an extracellular receptor domain. They provide an early warning system for the presence of potential pathogens and activate protective immune signalling in plants. In addition, they act as a signal amplifier in the case of tissue damage, establishing symbiotic relationships and effecting developmental processes. The identification of several important ligands for the RLK-type receptors provided an opportunity to understand how plants differentiate, how they distinguish beneficial and detrimental stimuli, and how they co-ordinate the role of various types of receptors under varying environmental conditions. The diverse roles of extra-and intracellular plant receptors are examined here and the recent findings on how they promote defence and development is reviewed.},

abstract={Gene conversion can have a profound impact on both the short- and long-term evolution of genes and genomes. Here, we examined the gene families that are located on the X-chromosomes of human (Homo sapiens), chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), mouse (Mus musculus) and rat (Rattus norvegicus) for evidence of gene conversion. We identified seven gene families (WD repeat protein family, Ferritin Heavy Chain family, RAS-related Protein RAB-40 family, Diphosphoinositol polyphosphate phosphohydrolase family, Transcription Elongation Factor A family, LDOC1-related family, Zinc Finger Protein ZIC, and GLI family) that show evidence of gene conversion. Through phylogenetic analyses and synteny evidence, we show that gene conversion has played an important role in the evolution of these gene families and that gene conversion has occurred independently in both primates and rodents. Comparing the results with those of two gene conversion prediction programs (GENECONV and Partimatrix), we found that both GENECONV and Partimatrix have very high false negative rates (i.e. failed to predict gene conversions), which leads to many undetected gene conversions. The combination of phylogenetic analyses with physical synteny evidence exhibits high resolution in the detection of gene conversions. © 2009 The Author(s).},

abstract={How ciliary and flagellar motility is regulated is a challenging problem. The flagellar movement in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is in part regulated by phosphorylation of a 138 kD intermediate chain (IC138) of inner arm dynein f (also called I1). In the present study, we found that the axoneme of mutants lacking dynein f lacks a novel protein having ankyrin repeat motifs, registered as FAP120 in the flagellar proteome database. FAP120 is also missing or decreased in the axonemes of bop5, a mutant that has a mutation in the structural gene of IC138 but assembles the dynein f complex. Intriguingly, the amounts of FAP120 in the axonemes of different alleles of bop5 and several dynein f-lacking mutants roughly parallel their contents of IC138. These results suggest a weak but stoichiometric interaction between FAP120 and IC138. We propose that FAP120 functions in the regulatory process as part of a protein complex involving IC138. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract={RPM1 -interacting protein 4 (RIN4), a negative regulator of the basal defense response in plants, is targeted by multiple bacterial virulence effectors. We show that RIN4 degradation is induced by the effector AvrPto from Pseudomonas syringae and that this degradation in Solanaceous plants is dependent on the resistance protein, Pto, a protein kinase, and Prf, a nucleotide binding site-leucine-rich repeat protein. Our data demonstrate overlap between two of the best-characterized pathways for recognition of pathogen virulence effectors in plants. RIN4 interacts with multiple plant signaling components and bacterial effectors in yeast and in planta. AvrPto induces an endogenous proteolytic activity in both tomato [Solanum lycopersicum) and Nicotiana benthamiana that degrades RIN4 and requires the consensus site cleaved by the protease effector AvrRpt2. The interaction between AvrPto and Pto, but not the kinase activity of Pto, is required for proteolysis of RIN4. Analysis of many of the effectors comprising the secretome of P. syringae pv tomato DC3000 led to the identification of two additional sequence-unrelated effectors that can also induce degradation of RIN4. Therefore, multiple bacterial effectors besides AvrRpt2 elicit proteolysis of RIN4 in planta. © 2009 American Society of Plant Biologists.},

abstract={The tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor BZI-1 has been implicated in auxin-mediated gene regulation. Yeast two-hybrid analysis has led to the identification of two BZI-1 protein interaction partners: the heterodimerizing bZIP factor BZI-2 and an ankyrin repeat domain protein, ANK1. Analysis in transgenic plants confirms that low levels of functional BZI-1, BZI-2 and ANK1 result in reduced auxin responses. This finding indicates that the three proteins act in the same functional context. The in vivo interaction of ANK1 and BZI-1 has been confirmed by protoplast two-hybrid analysis, as well as by bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) studies. Whereas YFP-BZI-1 has been found to be localized in the nucleus, YFP-ANK1 resides in the cytosol. Nevertheless, the inhibition of nuclear export with the inhibitor leptomycin B (LMB) and the co-expression with BZI-1, as well as treatment with auxin, results in the accumulation of YFP-ANK1 in the nucleus. Whereas BZI-1 is a weak activator, BZI-1/BZI-2 heterodimers efficiently support transcription. Importantly, conditions that lead to the accumulation of ANK1 in the nucleus, such as the expression of an ANK1 protein fused to a nuclear localization sequence (NLS) or auxin treatment, lead to a significant enhancement of BZI-1/BZI-2-mediated transcription. We therefore propose a mechanism in which the nuclear accumulation of ANK1 enhances BZI-1/BZI-2-mediated transcription in an auxin-dependent manner, presumably facilitated by protein-protein interaction. In summary, this study defines novel components in auxin-dependent signalling and transcriptional control. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The muscular dystrophies are a large and heterogeneous group of neuromuscular disorders that can be classified according to the mode of inheritance, the clinical phenotype and the molecular defect. To better understand the pathological mechanisms of dysferlin myopathy we compared the protein-expression pattern in the muscle biopsies of six patients with this disease with six patients with limb girdle muscular dystrophy 2A, five with facioscapulohumeral dystrophy and six normal control subjects. To investigate differences in the expression levels of skeletal muscle proteins we used 2-DE and MS. Western blot or immunohistochemistry confirmed relevant results. The study showed specific increase expression of proteins involved in fast-to-slow fiber type conversion (ankyrin repeat protein 2), type I predominance (phosphorylated forms of slow troponin T), sarcomere stabilization (actinin-associated LIM protein), protein ubiquitination (TRIM 72) and skeletal muscle differentiation (Rho-GDP-dissociation inhibitor ly-GDI) in dysferlin myopathy. As anticipated, we also found differential expression of proteins common to all the muscular dystrophies studied. This comparative proteomic analysis suggests that in dysferlin myopathy (i) the type I fiber predominance is an active process of fiber type conversion rather than a selective loss of type II fibers and (ii) the dysregulation of proteins involved in muscle differentiation further confirms the role of dysferlin in this process. © 2009 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

abstract={There is an emerging interest in protein expression profiling with the aim of identifying novel diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets in breast cancer. We analyzed breast cancer tissues by 2-D DIGE using a narrow range IPG strip (pH 5.5-6.7) after the immunodepletion of serum albumin and Ig. Sixty-three protein spots were detected with more than ±1.8-fold differences (p <0.05 for three technical replicates) from a set of tissue samples in which three tumor and three nontumor samples were randomly selected from six breast cancer subjects and pooled separately. Of these, 53 proteins were successfully identified by MS. Among the proteins whose levels were increased, we identified three novel WD-repeat-motif-bearing proteins that have been known to be involved in actin remodeling: Arp2/3 complex subunit 2 (p34-Arc), coronin-1A and WD-repeat protein 1 (Wdr1). Significantly increased amounts of p34-Arc and coronin-1A in breast cancer were also shown by Western blot analysis of matched tumor and nontumor tissue samples (N = 11, p <0.05), and were consistent with the mRNA levels retrieved from publicly available microarray databases. The siRNA knockdown of p34-Arc attenuated the invasion of SK-BR3 breast cancer cells into Matrigel. In contrast, the overexpression of coronin-1A increased this invasive activity. Taken together, the cellular levels of p34-Arc and coronin-1A were linked to cancer development and migration. The data obtained from the present study provides new insight into the management of breast cancer. © 2009 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.},

abstract={Despite the efforts of breeders and the extensive use of fungicide control measures, late blight still remains a major threat to potato cultivation worldwide. The introduction of genetic resistance into cultivated potato is considered a valuable method to achieve durable resistance to late blight. Here, we report the identification and cloning of Rpi-vnt1.1, a previously uncharacterized late-blight resistance gene from Solanum venturii. The gene was identified by a classical genetic and physical mapping approach and encodes a coiled-coil nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat protein with high similarity to Tm-22 from S. lycopersicum which confers resistance against Tomato mosaic virus. Transgenic potato and tomato plants carrying Rpi-vnt1.1 were shown to be resistant to Phytophthora infestans. Of 11 P. infestans isolates tested, only isolate EC1 from Ecuador was able to overcome Rpi-vnt1.1 and cause disease on the inoculated plants. Alleles of Rpi-vnt1.1 (Rpi-vnt1.2 and Rpi-vnt1.3) that differed by only a few nucleotides were found in other late-blight-resistant accessions of S. venturii. The late blight resistance gene Rpi-phu1 from S. phureja is shown here to be identical to Rpi-vnt1.1, suggesting either that this strong resistance gene has been maintained since a common ancestor, due to selection pressure for blight resistance, or that genetic exchange between S. venturii and S. phureja has occurred at some time. © 2009 The American Phytopathological Society.},

abstract={To identify key genes in the regulation of salt tolerance in the mangrove plant Bruguiera gymnorhiza, transcriptome profiling in the lateral and main roots under conditions of salt stress was performed. Statistical analysis revealed that 175 and 403 of 11,997 genes shoewd significantly increased high expression in the lateral and main roots respectively. One hundred and sixty genes were up-regulated in both types of roots in the early time period, 1 to 12 h after salt treatment. Expression vectors for 28 selected salt responsive genes were constructed and transformed in Agrobacterium tumefaciens, and then screened for salt tolerance. A. tumefaciens transformed with genes for lipid transfer, zinc finger, and ankyrin repeat proteins showed enhanced salt tolerance. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing these three genes also exhibited increased tolerance to NaCl. These results indicate that Agrobacterium functional screening is an effective supplemental method of pre-screening genes involved in abiotic stress tolerance.},

abstract={Background: The entomopathogenic nematode Heterorhabditis bacteriophora and its symbiotic bacterium, Photorhabdus luminescens, are important biological control agents of insect pests. This nematode-bacterium-insect association represents an emerging tripartite model for research on mutualistic and parasitic symbioses. Elucidation of mechanisms underlying these biological processes may serve as a foundation for improving the biological control potential of the nematode-bacterium complex. This large-scale expressed sequence tag (EST) analysis effort enables gene discovery and development of microsatellite markers. These ESTs will also aid in the annotation of the upcoming complete genome sequence of H. bacteriophora. Results: A total of 31,485 high quality ESTs were generated from cDNA libraries of the adult H. bacteriophora TTO1 strain. Cluster analysis revealed the presence of 3,051 contigs and 7,835 singletons, representing 10,886 distinct EST sequences. About 72% of the distinct EST sequences had significant matches (E value < 1e-5) to proteins in GenBank's non-redundant (nr) and Wormpep190 databases. We have identified 12 ESTs corresponding to 8 genes potentially involved in RNA interference, 22 ESTs corresponding to 14 genes potentially involved in dauer-related processes, and 51 ESTs corresponding to 27 genes potentially involved in defense and stress responses. Comparison to ESTs and proteins of free-living nematodes led to the identification of 554 parasitic nematode-specific ESTs in H. bacteriophora, among which are those encoding F-box-like/WD-repeat protein theromacin, Bax inhibitor-1-like protein, and PAZ domain containing protein. Gene Ontology terms were assigned to 6,685 of the 10,886 ESTs. A total of 168 microsatellite loci were identified with primers designable for 141 loci. Conclusion: A total of 10,886 distinct EST sequences were identified from adult H. bacteriophora cDNA libraries. BLAST searches revealed ESTs potentially involved in parasitism, RNA interference, defense responses, stress responses, and dauer-related processes. The putative microsatellite markers identified in H. bacteriophora ESTs will enable genetic mapping and population genetic studies.

abstract={A stable and robust trypsin-based biocatalytic system was developed and demonstrated for pro-teomic applications. The system utilizes polymer nanofibers coated with trypsin aggregates for immobilized protease digestions. After covalently attaching an initial layer of trypsin to the polymer nanofibers, highly concentrated trypsin molecules are crosslinked to the layered trypsin by way of a glutaraldehyde treatment. This process produced a 300-fold increase in trypsin activity compared with a conventional method for covalent trypsin immobilization, and proved to be robust in that it still maintained a high level of activity after a year of repeated recycling. This highly stable form of immobilized trypsin was resistant to autolysis, enabling repeated digestions of BSA over 40 days and successful peptide identification by LC-MS/MS. This active and stable form of immobilized trypsin was successfully employed in the digestion of yeast proteome extract with high reproducibility and within shorter time than conventional protein digestion using solution phase trypsin. Finally, the immobilized trypsin was resistant to proteolysis when exposed to other enzymes (i.e., chymotrypsin), which makes it suitable for use in "real-world" proteomic applications. Overall, the biocatalytic nanofibers with trypsin aggregate coatings proved to be an effective approach for repeated and automated protein digestion in proteomic analyses. © 2009 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

abstract={Cyclin E/Cdk2 is a key regulator in G1-S transition. We have identified a novel cyclin E/Cdk2 substrate called Ankrd17 (ankyrin repeat protein 17) using the TAP tag purification technique. Ankrd17 protein contains two clusters of a total 25 ankyrin repeats at its N terminus, one NES (nuclear exporting signal) and one NLS (nuclear localization signal) in the middle, and one RXL motif at its C terminus. Ankrd17 is expressed in various tissues and associates with cyclin E/ Cdk2 in an RXL-dependent manner. It can be phosphorylated by cyclin E/ Cdk2 at 3 phosphorylation sites (Ser1791, Ser1794, and Ser2150). Overexpression of Ankrd17 promotes S phase entry, whereas depletion of Ankrd17 expression by small interfering RNA inhibits DNA replication and blocks cell cycle progression as well as up-regulates the expression of p53 and p21. Ankrd17 is localized to the nucleus and interacts with DNA replication factors including MCMfamily members, Cdc6 and PCNA. Depletion of Ankrd17 results in decreased loading of Cdc6 and PCNA onto DNA suggesting that Ankrd17 may be directly involved in the DNA replication process. Taken together, these data indicate that Ankrd17 is an important downstream effector of cyclin E/Cdk2 and positively regulates G1/S transition. © 2009 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

abstract={A growing number of solved protein structures display an elongated structural domain, denoted here as alpha-rod, composed of stacked pairs of anti-parallel alpha-helices. Alpha-rods are flexible and expose a large surface, which makes them suitable for protein interaction. Although most likely originating by tandem duplication of a two-helix unit, their detection using sequence similarity between repeats is poor. Here, we show that alpha-rod repeats can be detected using a neural network. The network detects more repeats than are identified by domain databases using multiple profiles, with a low level of false positives (<10%). We identify alpha-rod repeats in approximately 0.4% of proteins in eukaryotic genomes. We then investigate the results for all human proteins, identifying alpha-rod repeats for the first time in six protein families, including proteins STAG1-3, SERAC1, and PSMD1-2 and 5. We also characterize a short version of these repeats in eight protein families of Archaeal, Bacterial, and Fungal species. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of these predictions in directing experimental work to demarcate three alpha-rods in huntingtin, a protein mutated in Huntington's disease. Using yeast two hybrid analysis and an immunoprecipitation technique, we show that the huntingtin fragments containing alpha-rods associate with each other. This is the first definition of domains in huntingtin and the first validation of predicted interactions between fragments of huntingtin, which sets up directions toward functional characterization of this protein. An implementation of the repeat detection algorithm is available as a Web server with a simple graphical output: http:// www.ogic.ca/projects/ard. This can be further visualized using BiasViz, a graphic tool for representation of multiple sequence alignments.},

abstract={Adventitious organogenesis in plant tissue culture involves de novo formation of apical meristems and should therefore provide important information about the fundamentals of meristem gene networks. We identified novel factors required for neoformation of the shoot apical meristem (SAM) through an analysis of shoot regeneration in root initiation defective3 (rid3) and root growth defective3 (rgd3) temperature-sensitive mutants of Arabidopsis. After induction of callus to regenerate shoots, cell division soon ceased and was then reactivated locally in the surface region, resulting in formation of mounds of dense cells in which adventitious-bud SAMs were eventually constructed. The rgd3 mutation inhibited reactivation of cell division and suppressed expression of CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON1 (CUC1), CUC2 and SHOOT MERISTEMLESS (STM). In contrast, the rid3 mutation caused excess ill-controlled cell division on the callus surface. This was intimately related to enhanced and broadened expression of CUC1. Positional cloning revealed that the RGD3 and RID3 genes encode BTAF1 (a kind of TATA-binding protein-associated factor) and an uncharacterized WD-40 repeat protein, respectively. In the early stages of shoot regeneration, RGD3 was expressed (as was CUC1) in the developing cell mounds, whereas RID3 was expressed outside the cell mounds. When RID3 was over-expressed artificially, the expression levels of CUC1 and STM were significantly reduced. Taken together, these findings show that both negative regulation by RID3 and positive regulation by RGD3 of the CUC-STM pathway participate in proper control of cell division as a prerequisite for SAM neoformation. © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The Notch ankyrin domain is a repeat protein whose folding has been characterized through equilibrium and kinetic measurements. In previous work, equilibrium folding free energies of truncated constructs were used to generate an experimentally determined folding energy landscape (Mello and Barrick, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 2004;101:14102-14107). Here, this folding energy landscape is used to parameterize a kinetic model in which local transition probabilities between partly folded states are based on energy values from the landscape. The landscape-based model correctly predicts highly diverse experimentally determined folding kinetics of the Notch ankyrin domain and sequence variants. These predictions include monophasic folding and biphasic unfolding, curvature in the unfolding limb of the chevron plot, population of a transient unfolding intermediate, relative folding rates of 19 variants spanning three orders of magnitude, and a change in the folding pathway that results from C-terminal stabilization. These findings indicate that the folding pathway(s) of the Notch ankyrin domain are thermodynamically selected: the primary determinants of kinetic behavior can be simply deduced from the local stability of individual repeats.

abstract={Effector-triggered immunity provides plants with strong protection from pathogens. However, this response has the potential to be highly deleterious to the host and needs to be tightly controlled. The molecular mechanisms in the plant that regulate the balance between activation and suppression of resistance are not fully understood. Previously, we identified Arabidopsis suppressor of rps4-RLD 1 (srfr1) mutants with enhanced resistance to the bacterial effector AvrRps4. These mutants were recessive and retained full susceptibility to virulent bacteria, suggesting that SRFR1 functions as a negative regulator and that AvrRps4-triggered immunity was specifically enhanced in the mutants. Consistent with this, we show here that the response to flagellin, an elicitor of basal resistance, is unaltered in srfr1-1. In contrast, resistance to AvrRps4 in srfr1-1 requires EDS1, a central regulator of effector-triggered immunity via multiple resistance genes. SRFR1 is a single-copy gene encoding a pioneer tetratricopeptide repeat protein conserved between plants and animals. The SRFR1 tetratricopeptide repeat domain shows sequence similarity to those of transcriptional repressors in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Caenorhabditis elegans. Indeed, a sub-pool of SRFR1 transiently expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana leaf cells localizes to the nucleus. Identification of SRFR1 may therefore provide insight into the regulation of the transcriptional reprogramming that is activated by effector-triggered immunity. © 2008 The Authors.},

abstract={Leucine-rich repeat proteins (LRRs) play important roles in signal perception and activation of defense responses. We isolated two new LRR genes, NtLRR1 and NtLRR2, in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum). NtLRR1 and NtLRR2 are characterized by 9 and 3 LRR domains, respectively. The phylogenetic relationships show that NtLRR1 and NtLRR2 belong to different subfamilies of the polygalacturonase inhibitor proteins (PGIPs) and LRP-related proteins (LRPs), respectively. NtLRR1 and NtLRR2 are responsive to pathogen attack and salt stress, but display differential expression patterns in tobacco. NtLRR1 is activated rapidly by infection with the tobacco wildfire pathogen (Pseudomonas syringae pv. tabaci), but slowly by tobacco mosaic virus (TMV). In contrast, NtLRR2 transcripts rapidly accumulate after infection with TMV, and only sluggishly with infection by the wildfire pathogen. In addition, NtLRR1 transcripts abundantly accumulate in stems, whereas NtLRR2 appears mainly in the roots. Isolation of the NtLRR2 promoter revealed some cis-acting elements responding to stresses and defense signal molecules. Subcellular localization indicated that NtLRR1 and NtLRR2 proteins localize in the cell walls and plasma membranes, respectively. It was concluded that NtLRR1 and NtLRR2 are important proteins having different functions in response to different stresses and mediating in binding interactions in a wide variety of biological processes. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

abstract={Background: The small leucine-rich repeat proteins and proteoglycans (SLRPs) form an important family of regulatory molecules that participate in many essential functions. They typically control the correct assembly of collagen fibrils, regulate mineral deposition in bone, and modulate the activity of potent cellular growth factors through many signalling cascades. SLRPs belong to the group of extracellular leucine-rich repeat proteins that are flanked at both ends by disulphide-bonded caps that protect the hydrophobic core of the terminal repeats. A capping motif specific to SLRPs has been recently described in the crystal structures of the core proteins of decorin and biglycan. This motif, designated as LRRCE, differs in both sequence and structure from other, more widespread leucine-rich capping motifs. To investigate if the LRRCE motif is a common structural feature found in other leucine-rich repeat proteins, we have defined characteristic sequence patterns and used them in genome-wide searches. Results: The LRRCE motif is a structural element exclusive to the main group of SLRPs. It appears to have evolved during early chordate evolution and is not found in protein sequences from non-chordate genomes. Our search has expanded the family of SLRPs to include new predicted protein sequences, mainly in fishes but with intriguing putative orthologs in mammals. The chromosomal locations of the newly predicted SLRP genes would support the large-scale genome or gene duplications that are thought to have occurred during vertebrate evolution. From this expanded list we describe a new class of SLRP sequences that could be representative of an ancestral SLRP gene. Conclusion: Given its exclusivity the LRRCE motif is a useful annotation tool for the identification and classification of new SLRP sequences in genome databases. The expanded list of members of the SLRP family offers interesting insights into early vertebrate evolution and suggests an early chordate evolutionary origin for the LRRCE capping motif. © 2008 Park et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={Several plant pathogenic oomycetes have been under investigation using modern molecular approaches. Genome sequencing and annotations are underway or near to completion for some of the species. Pathogen-associated molecular pattern molecules (PAMPs) and effector molecules perform inter-and intracellular tasks as adaptation factors and manipulators of the defence network. Hundreds of secreted putative effectors have been discovered and conserved molecular patterns such as RXLR and EER motifs have been identified and used for classifications. PAMPs and effectors are recognized directly or indirectly by the pattern recognition receptors at the cell surface including receptor-like kinases and receptor-like proteins, and/or by nucleotide binding site-leucine rich repeat proteins within the cytoplasm. The current knowledge of effectors, immune receptors and the defence network, will help us understand the 'intricate genetic dance' between the oomycete pathogens and their hosts. This review concentrates on the recent findings in oomycete-plant interactions. © 2008 Springer Netherlands.},

abstract={The mixed lineage leukemia protein-1 (MLL1) catalyzes histone H3 lysine 4 methylation and is regulated by interaction with WDR5 (WD-repeat protein-5), RbBP5 (retinoblastoma-binding protein-5), and the Ash2L (absent, small, homeotic discs-2-like) oncoprotein. In the accompanying investigation, we describe the identification of a conserved arginine containing motif, called the "Win" or WDR5 interaction motif, that is essential for the assembly and H3K4 dimethylation activity of the MLL1 core complex. Here we present a 1.7-Å crystal structure of WDR5 bound to a peptide derived from the MLL1 Win motif. Our results show that Arg-3765 of MLL1 is bound in the same arginine binding pocket on WDR5 that was previously suggested to bind histone H3. Thermodynamic binding experiments show that the MLL1 Win peptide is preferentially recognized by WDR5. These results are consistent with a model in which WDR5 recognizes Arg-3765 of MLL1, which is essential for the assembly and enzymatic activity of the MLL1 core complex. © 2008 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

abstract={Mutations in SRPX2 (Sushi-Repeat Protein, X-linked 2) cause rolandic epilepsy with speech impairment (RESDX syndrome) or with altered development of the speech cortex (bilateral perisylvian polymicrogyria). The physiological roles of SRPX2 remain unknown to date. One way to infer the function of SRPX2 relies on the identification of the as yet unknown SRPX2 protein partners. Using a combination of interactome approaches including yeast two-hybrid screening, co-immunoprecipitation experiments, cell surface binding and surface plasmon resonance (SPR), we show that SRPX2 is a ligand for uPAR, the urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) receptor. Previous studies have shown that uPAR-/- knock-out mice exhibited enhanced susceptibility to epileptic seizures and had brain cortical anomalies consistent with altered neuronal migration and maturation, all features that are reminiscent to the phenotypes caused by SRPX2 mutations. SPR analysis indicated that the p.Y72S mutation associated with rolandic epilepsy and perisylvian polymicrogyria, led to a 5.8-fold gain-of-affinity of SRPX2 with uPAR. uPAR is a crucial component of the extracellular plasminogen proteolysis system; two more SRPX2 partners identified here, the cysteine protease cathepsin B (CTSB) and the metalloproteinase ADAMTS4, are also components of the extracellular proteolysis machinery and CTSB is a well-known activator of uPA. The identification of functionally related SRPX2 partners provides the first and exciting insights into the possible role of SRPX2 in the brain, and suggests that a network of SRPX2-interacting proteins classically involved in the proteolytic remodeling of the extracellular matrix and including uPAR participates in the functioning, in the development and in disorders of the speech cortex. © The Author 2008.

At least three different use cases can be envisaged: (i) benchmarking of novel methods; (ii) test sets tailored for special needs and (iii) extending available datasets. The CATH structure classification is used to control structural/sequence redundancy and a variety of structural quality parameters can be used to interactively select protein subsets with specific characteristics, e.g. all X-ray structures of α-helical repeat proteins with more than 120 residues and resolution <2.0 Å. The output includes FASTA-formatted sequences, PDB files and a clickable HTML index file containing images of the selected proteins. Multiple subsets for cross-validation are also supported. © The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The complexity of the mechanisms by which proteins fold has been shown by many studies to be governed by their native-state topologies. This was manifested in the ability of the native topology-based model to capture folding mechanisms and the success of folding rate predictions based on various topological measures, such as the contact order. However, while the finer details of topological complexity have been thoroughly examined and related to folding kinetics, simpler characteristics of the protein, such as its overall shape, have been largely disregarded. In this study, we investigated the folding of proteins with an unusual elongated geometry that differs substantially from the common globular structure. To study the effect of the elongation degree on the folding kinetics, we used repeat proteins, which become more elongated as they include more repeating units. Some of these have apparently anomalous experimental folding kinetics, with rates that are often less than expected on the basis of rates for globular proteins possessing similar topological complexity. Using experimental folding rates and a larger set of rates obtained from simulations, we have shown that as the protein becomes increasingly elongated, its folding kinetics becomes slower and deviates more from the rate expected on the basis of topology measures fitted for globular proteins. The observed slow kinetics is a result of a more complex pathway in which stable intermediates composed of several consecutive repeats can appear. We thus propose a novel measure, an elongation-sensitive contact order, that takes into account both the extent of elongation and the topological complexity of the protein. This new measure resolves the apparent discrimination between the folding of globular and elongated repeat proteins. Our study extends the current capabilities of folding-rate predictions by unifying the kinetics of repeat and globular proteins. © 2008 American Chemical Society.},

The two fulllength cDNAs (Ng0881 and Ngl851), which encode the WD repeat protein and auxin-regulated protein, were cloned, and the complete nucleotide sequences were determined. The deduced amino acid sequence for Ng0881 has seven repetitive WD repeats, sharing 81% identical residues with the homologue from Oryza sativa, while that for Ng1851 shares 68% identical residues with the auxin-regulated protein from Oryza sativa. It could be speculated that translational products of the genes ng0881 and ng1851 may serve as signal mediators required for TMV-resistance.},

abstract={Hypoparathyroidism is the most common endocrine disorder detected in patients with autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 1 (APS-1); however, a parathyroid-specific autoantibody has not yet been identified. Alimohammadi et al. have screened a human parathyroid complementary DNA library with serum samples from patients with APS-1 and detected NACHT leucine-rich-repeat protein 5 (NALP5) immunoreactivity in 49% of patients with APS-1-associated hypoparathyroidism. When measured with a novel fluid-phase radioimmunoassay, these autoantibodies were found to be highly specific for the hypoparathyroid component of APS-1. In addition, NALP5 was predominantly expressed in the parathyroid gland. In this Practice Point commentary, I discuss the mechanistic and diagnostic implications of this finding for patients with APS-1. The natural history of NALP5 autoantibody expression in relation to the development of hypoparathyroidism is currently unclear. Furthermore, the positive and negative predictive value of NALP5 autoantibodies for the prediction of hypoparathyroidism among patients with APS-1 still needs to be defined. © 2008 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract={In organelles, the posttranscriptional steps of gene expression are tightly controlled by nucleus-encoded factors, most often acting in a gene-specific manner. Despite the molecular identification of a growing number of factors, their mode of action remains largely unknown. In the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, expression of the chloroplast petA gene, which codes for cytochrome f, depends on two specific nucleus-encoded factors. MCA1 controls the accumulation of the transcript, while TCA1 is required for its translation. We report here the cloning of MCA1, the first pentatricopeptide repeat protein functionally identified in this organism. By chloroplast transformation with modified petA genes, we investigated the function of MCA1 in vivo. We demonstrate that MCA1 acts on the very first 21 nucleotides of the petA 5′ untranslated region to protect the whole transcript from 5′→3′ degradation but does not process the 5′ end of the petA mRNA. MCA1 and TCA1 recognize adjacent targets and probably interact together for efficient expression of petA mRNA. MCA1, although not strictly required for translation, shows features of a translational enhancer, presumably by assisting the binding of TCA1 to its own target. Conversely, TCA1 participates to the full stabilization of the transcript through its interaction with MCA1. Copyright © 2008, American Society for Microbiology. All Rights Reserved.},

abstract={Objective A comparative proteomic analysis on two human large cell lung cancer strains with high metastasis potential (L9981) and low metastasis potential (NL9980) were conducted. Methods The total proteins of the two cell lines were separated by immobilized pH gradient (IPG)-based two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. The differential expression proteins of the two cell lines were analyzed using image analysis software. Thirteen differential expressed proteins were further identified using in-gel digestion with trypsin, of which peptide extracts were prepared for MALDI-TOF MS/MS analysis by Daltonics AutoFlex TOF-TOF LIFT Mass Spectrometer (Bruker). Protein identifications were searched in the NCBInr protein database using the Mascot search engine. Results Protein image analysis indicated that 8 protein spots were observed only in L9981, not in NL9980; 8 protein spots were observed only in NL9980, not in L9981; 19 protein spots were detected in both L9981 and NL9980, of which 9 showed significantly higher volumes in L9981 than in NL9980 and 10 showed significantly higher volumes in NL9980 than in L9981. MS and biological informatics study found that the expressions of heat shock 70 kD protein 9B precursor, MTHSP75 and glutathione synthetas incerased in L9981 cells. However, a variant of P47 protein, immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region, enolasel, heat shock protein and eukaryotic translation initiation fact 3 were down-regulated in L9981 cells. Pyruvate kinase (PK) was only expressed in L9981 cells while WD-40 repeat protein was only expressed in NL9980 cells. Conclusions The metastatic lung cancer cell lines display different protein profiles compared to the non metastatic lung cancer cell lines. The identified proteins are likely to be associated with tumor metastasis, which could serve as a basis for searching potential prognosis markers of lung cancer and elucidating the mechanisms of the metastasis of lung cancer.},

abstract={The centrosome functions as the microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) and plays a vital role in organizing spindle poles during mitosis. The pair of centrioles, which are the core components of the centrosome, duplicate once per cell cycle, and this feature is essential for the establishment of spindle bipolarity. Here we describe the molecular characterization of a novel protein called CLERC (Centrosomal leucine-rich repeat and coiled-coil containing protein) which is a human ortholog of Chlamydomonas Vfl1 protein. CLERC is a protein of 1032 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 120 kDa and possesses leucine-rich repeat and coiled-coil domains. Database searches revealed that CLERC has homologs in a wide variety of eukaryotes and is evolutionarily conserved. Endogenous CLERC protein associated with the centrosomes throughout the cell cycle and accumulated during mitosis. RNAi-mediated depletion of CLERC blocked formation of normal mitotic spindles and led to multipolar spindles. Moreover, many of the spindle poles in CLERC depleted cells contained only one centriole, indicating that centrosomes split into fractions containing a single centriole. These data indicate that the major function of CLERC during mitosis is to maintain the structural integrity of centrosomes, thereby contributing to spindle bipolarity. ©2008 Landes Bioscience.},

abstract={The pyrimidine exchange type of RNA editing in land plant (embryophyte) organelles has largely remained an enigma with respect to its biochemical mechanisms, the underlying specificities, and its raison d'être. Apparently arising with the earliest embryophytes, RNA editing is conspicuously absent in one clade of liverworts, the complex thalloid Marchantiidae. Several lines of evidence suggest that the large gene family of organelle-targeted RNA-binding pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins plays a fundamental role in the sequence-specific editing of organelle transcripts. We here describe the identification of PPR protein genes with plant-specific carboxyterminal (C-terminal) sequence signatures (E, E+, and DYW domains) in ferns, lycopodiophytes, mosses, hornworts, and jungermanniid liverworts, one subclass of the basal most clade of embryophytes, on DNA and cDNA level. In contrast, we were unable to identify these genes in a wide sampling of marchantiid liverworts (including the phylogenetic basal genus Blasia) - taxa for which no RNA editing is observed in the organelle transcripts. On the other hand, we found significant diversity of this type of PPR proteins also in Haplomitrium, a genus with an extremely high rate of RNA editing and a phylogenetic placement basal to all other liverworts. Although the presence of modularly extended PPR proteins correlates well with organelle RNA editing, the now apparent complete loss of an entire gene family from one clade of embryophytes, the marchantiid liverworts, remains puzzling. © The Author 2008.

abstract={Repeat proteins contain tandem arrays of a simple structural motif. In contrast to globular proteins, repeat proteins are stabilized only by interactions between residues that are relatively close together in the sequence, with no "long-range" interactions. Our work focuses on the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR), a 34 amino acid helix-turn-helix motif found in tandem arrays in many natural proteins. Earlier, we reported the design and characterization of a series of consensus TPR (CTPR) proteins, which are built as arrays of multiple tandem copies of a 34 amino acid consensus sequence. Here, we present the results of extensive hydrogen exchange (HX) studies of the folding-unfolding behavior of two CTPR proteins (CTPR2 and CTPR3). We used HX to detect and characterize partially folded species that are populated at low frequency in the nominally folded state. We show that for both proteins the equilibrium folding-unfolding transition is non-two-state, but sequential, with the outermost helices showing a significantly higher probability than inner helices of being unfolded. We show that the experimentally observed unfolding behavior is consistent with the predictions of a simple Ising model, in which individual helices are treated as "spin-equivalents". The results that we present have general implications for our understanding of the thermodynamic properties of repeat proteins. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={p120-catenin (p120ctn) is an armadillo-repeat protein that directly binds to the intracytoplasmic domains of classical cadherins. p120ctn binding promotes the stabilization of cadherin complexes on the plasma membrane and thus positively regulates the adhesive activity of cadherins. Using co-immunoprecipitation, we show here that p120ctn associates to desmogleins (Dsg) 1 and 3. To determine which region is involved in the association between Dsg3 and p120ctn, we constructed mutant Dsg3 proteins, in which various cytoplasmic subdomains were removed. The tailless Dsg3 constructs ΔIA:AA1-641Dsg3 and Δ641-714Dsg3, which do not contain the intracellular anchor (IA) region, did not coprecipitate with p120cn, nor did they colocalize at the plasma membrane. Immunocytochemical analysis revealed that p120ctn does not localize to desmosomes, but colocalizes with Dsg3 at the cell surface. A biotinylation assay for Dsg3 showed that biotinylated Δ641-714Dsg3 was turned over more rapidly than wild-type Dsg3. These results indicate that the membrane proximal region (corresponding to residues 641-714) in the IA region of Dsg3 is necessary for complex formation with p120ctn, and to maintain free Dsg3 at the cell surface before it is integrated into desmosomes. In summary, we show that p120ctn is a novel interactor of the Dsg proteins, and may play a role in desmosome remodeling. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

These include the WD40 repeat protein WDS, the PHD and HAT domain protein CG10414 (herein renamed Atac2/KAT14), the YEATS family member D12, the histone fold proteins CHRAC14 and NC2β, CG30390, CG32343 (Atac3) and CG10238. The presence of CG10414 (Atac2) suggests that it acts as a second acetyltransferase enzyme in ATAC in addition to Gcn5. Indeed, recombinant Atac2 displays HAT activity in vitro with a preference for acetylating histone H4, and mutation of Atac2 abrogated H4 lysine 16 acetylation in D. melanogaster embryos. Furthermore, although ATAC does not show nucleosome-remodeling activity itself, it stimulates nucleosome sliding by the ISWI, SWI-SNF and RSC complexes. © 2008 Nature Publishing Group.},

abstract={As the largest class of disease resistance R genes, the genes encoding nucleotide binding site and leucine-rich repeat proteins ("NBS-LRR genes") play a critical role in defending plants from a multitude of pathogens and pests. The diversity of NBS-LRR genes was examined in the Populus trichocarpa draft genome sequence. The NBS class of genes in this perennial tree is large and diverse, comprised of ∼400 genes, at least twice the complement of Arabidopsis. The NBS family can be divided into multiple subfamilies with distinct domain organizations. It includes 119 Coiled-Coil-NBS-LRR genes, 64 TIR-NBS-LRR genes, 34 BED-finger-NBS-LRR, and both truncated and unusual NBS- and NBS-LRR-containing genes. The transcripts of only 34 NBS-LRR genes were detected in rust-infected and non-infected leaves using a whole-genome oligoarray.

abstract={Motivation: An estimated 25% of all eukaryotic proteins contain repeats, which underlines the importance of duplication for evolving new protein functions. Internal repeats often correspond to structural or functional units in proteins. Methods capable of identifying diverged repeated segments or domains at the sequence level can therefore assist in predicting domain structures, inferring hypotheses about function and mechanism, and investigating the evolution of proteins from smaller fragments. Results: We present HHrepID, a method for the de novo identification of repeats in protein sequences. It is able to detect the sequence signature of structural repeats in many proteins that have not yet been known to possess internal sequence symmetry, such as outer membrane β-barrels. HHrepID uses HMM-HMM comparison to exploit evolutionary information in the form of multiple sequence alignments of homologs. In contrast to a previous method, the new method (1) generates a multiple alignment of repeats; (2) utilizes the transitive nature of homology through a novel merging procedure with fully probabilistic treatment of alignments; (3) improves alignment quality through an algorithm that maximizes the expected accuracy; (4) is able to identify different kinds of repeats within complex architectures by a probabilistic domain boundary detection method and (5) improves sensitivity through a new approach to assess statistical significance. © The Author 2008.

abstract={Malaria caused by protozoan parasites belonging to the genus Plasmodium is a dreaded disease, second only to tuberculosis. The emergence of parasites resistant to commonly used drugs and the lack of availability of vaccines aggravates the problem. One of the preventive approaches targets adhesion of parasites to host cells and tissues. Adhesion of parasites is mediated by proteins called adhesins. Abrogation of adhesion by either immunizing the host with adhesins or inhibiting the interaction using structural analogs of host cell receptors holds the potential to develop novel preventive strategies. The availability of complete genome sequence offers new opportunities for identifying adhesin and adhesin-like proteins. Development of computational algorithms can simplify this task and accelerate experimental characterization of the predicted adhesins from complete genomes. A curated positive dataset of experimentally known adhesins from Plasmodium species was prepared by careful examination of literature reports. "Controversial" or "hypothetical" adhesins were excluded. The negative dataset consisted of proteins representing various intracellular functions including information processing, metabolism, and interface (transporters). We did not include proteins likely to be on the surface with unknown adhesin properties or which are linked even indirectly to the adhesion process in either of the training sets. A nonhomology-based approach using 420 compositional properties of amino acid dipeptide and multiplet frequencies was used to develop MAAP Web server with Support Vector Machine (SVM) model classifier as its engine for the prediction of malarial adhesins and adhesin-like proteins. The MAAP engine has six SVM classifier models identified through an exhaustive search from 728 kernel parameters set. These models displayed an efficiency (Mathews correlation coefficient) of 0.860-0.967. The final prediction Pmaap score is the maximum score attained by a given sequence in any of the six models. The results of MAAP runs on complete proteomes of Plasmodium species revealed that in Plasmodium falciparum at Pmaap scores above 0.0, we observed a sensitivity of 100% with two false positives. In P. vivax and P. yoelii an optimal threshold Pmaap score of 0.7 was optimal with very few false positives (upto 5). Several new predictions were obtained. This list includes hypothetical protein PF14_0040, interspersed repeat antigen, STEVOR, liver stage antigen, SURFIN, RIFIN, stevor (3D7-stevorT3-2), mature parasite-infected erythrocyte surface antigen or P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 2, merozoite surface protein 6 in P. falciparum, circumsporozoite proteins, microneme protein-1, Vir18, Vir12-like, Vir12, Vir18-like, Vir18-related and Vir4 in P. vivax, circumsporozoite protein/thrombospondin related anonymous proteins, 28 kDa ookinete surface protein, yir1, and yir4 of P. yoelii. Among these, a few proteins identified by MAAP were matched with those identified by other groups using different experimental and theoretical strategies. Most other interspersed repeat proteins in Plasmodium species had lower Pmaap scores. These new predictions could serve as new leads for further experimental characterization (MAAP webserver: http://maap.igib.res.in). © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

AR proteins show highly cooperative folding despite a lack of long-range contacts. Both theory and experiment converge to explain that formation of the interface between elements is more favorable than formation of any individual repeat unit. IκBα and Notch both undergo partial folding upon binding perhaps influencing the binding free energy. The simple architecture, combined with identification of consensus residues that are important for stability, has enabled systematic perturbation of the energy landscape by single point mutations that affect stability or by addition of consensus repeats.

abstract={Background: Spermatogenesis is comprised of a series of highly regulated developmental changes that transform the precursor germ cell into a highly specialized spermatozoon. The last phase of spermatogenesis, termed spermiogenesis, involves dramatic morphological change including formation of the acrosome, elongation and condensation of the nucleus, formation of the flagella, and disposal of unnecessary cytoplasm. A prominent cytoskeletal component of the developing spermatid is the manchette, a unique microtubular structure that surrounds the nucleus of the developing spermatid and is thought to assist in both the reshaping of the nucleus and redistribution of spermatid cytoplasm. Although the molecular motor KIFC1 has been shown to associate with the manchette, its precise role in function of the manchette and the identity of its testis specific protein partners are unknown. The purpose of this study was to identify proteins in the testis that interact with KIFC1 using a yeast 2 hybrid screen of a testis cDNA library. Results: Thirty percent of the interacting clones identified in our screen contain an identical cDNA encoding a 40 kD protein. This interacting protein has 4 leucine-rich repeats in its amino terminal half and is expressed primarily in the testis; therefore we have named this protein testis leucine-rich repeat protein or TLRR. TLRR was also found to associate tightly with the KIFC1 targeting domain using affinity chromatography. In addition to the leucine-rich repeats, TLRR contains a consensus-binding site for protein phosphatase-1 (PP1). Immunocytochemistry using a TLRR specific antibody demonstrates that this protein is found near the manchette of developing spermatids. Conclusion: We have identified a previously uncharacterized leucine-rich repeat protein that is expressed abundantly in the testis and associates with the manchette of developing spermatids, possibly through its interaction with the KIFC1 molecular motor. TLRR is homologous to a class of regulatory subunits for PP1, a central phosphatase in the reversible phosphorylation of proteins that is key to modulation of many intracellular processes. TLRR may serve to target this important signaling molecule near the nucleus of developing spermatids in order to control the cellular rearrangements of spermiogenesis. © 2008 Wang and Sperry; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={Background: The expression and activity of ribonucleotide reductase (RR) has been associated with resistance to multiple drugs in human cancer. The use of antisense oligonucleotide drug, GTI-2040, a 20-mer phosphorothioate oligonucleotide complemented to the human RR M2 subunit mRNA, represents an effective strategy for inhibiting RR. The increased specificity due to the anti-resistance effect of GTI-2040 may also lead to a more favorable therapeutic outcome. Materials and Methods: To understand the molecular mechanism underlying RR inhibition, patients' blood samples were analyzed using multiple dimensional proteomics technology via matrix-assisted laser desorption and ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. Results: A major difference occurred at 5k mlz in the MALDI profile, which appeared only in the non-responsive group and diminished after GTI-2040 treatment. This specific peptide peak remained at the basal level in responsive patients. The peak was identified to represent the F-box/LLR-repeat protein 17 (FBXL17) through nanoelectrospray ionization liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (nanoESI LC-MS/MS). Further characterization revealed that FBXL17/SKP2 directly interacts with the human RR M2 (RRM2) subunit to promote hRRM2 overexpression in the breast cancer cell line MCF-7. Conclusion: Validation of this protein using real-time RT-PCR indicates the F-box protein 17 (FBXL17) can serve as a therapeutic target and surrogate marker for breast cancer therapy.},

abstract={In filamentous fungi, hyphal extension depends on the continuous delivery of vesicles to the growing tip. Here, we describe the identification of two cell end marker proteins, TeaA and TeaR, in Aspergillus nidulans, corresponding to Tea1 and Mod5 in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Deletion of teaA or teaR caused zig-zag-growing and meandering hyphae, respectively. The Kelch-repeat protein TeaA, the putatively prenylated TeaR protein, and the formin SepA were highly concentrated in the Spitzenkörper, a vesicle transit station at the tip, and localized along the tip membrane. TeaA localization at tips depended on microtubules, and TeaA was required for microtuble convergence in the hyphal apex. The CENP-E family kinesin KipA was necessary for proper localization of TeaA and TeaR, but not for their transportation. TeaA and TeaR localization were interdependent. TeaA interacted in vivo with TeaR, and TeaA colocalized with SepA. Sterol-rich membrane domains localized at the tip in teaA and teaR mutants like in wild type, and filipin treatment caused mislocalization of both proteins. This suggests that sterol-rich membrane domains determine cell end factor destinations and thereby polarized growth. © 2007 by The American Society for Cell Biology.},

abstract={The rapid burgeoning of available protein data makes the use of clustering within families of proteins increasingly important, the challenge is to identify subfamilies of evolutionarily related sequences. This identification reveals phylogenetic relationships, which provide prior knowledge to help researchers understand biological phenomena. A good evolutionary model is essential to achieve a clustering that reflects the biological reality, and an accurate estimate of protein sequence similarity is crucial to the building of such a model. Most existing algorithms estimate this similarity using techniques that are not necessarily biologically plausible, especially for hard-to-align sequences such as multi-domain, circular-permutation and tandem-repeats protein sequences, which cause many difficulties for the alignment-dependent algorithms. In this paper, we propose a novel similarity measure based on matching amino acid subsequences. This measure, named SMS for Substitution Matching Similarity, is especially designed for application to non-aligned protein sequences. It allows us to develop a new alignment-independent algorithm, named CLUSS, for clustering protein families. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first alignment-free algorithm for clustering protein sequences. Unlike other clustering algorithms, CLUSS is effective on both alignable and non-alignable protein families. ©2007 IEEE.},

A full-length cDNA clone of the Capsicum annuum ankyrin-repeat domain C3H1 zinc finger protein (CaKR1) was identified in a chili pepper using the expressed sequence tag (EST) database. The deduced amino acid sequence of CaKR1 showed a significant sequence similarity (46%) to the ankyrin-repeat protein in very diverse family of proteins of Arabidopsis. The gene was induced in response to various biotic and abiotic stresses in the pepper leaves, as well as by an incompatible pathogen, such as salicylic acid (SA) and ethephon. CaKR1 expression was highest in the root and flower, and its expression was induced by treatment with agents such as NaCl and methyl viologen, as well as by cold stresses. These results showed that CaKR1 fusion with soluble, modified green fluorescent protein (smGFP) was localized to the cytosol in Arabidopsis protoplasts, suggesting that CaKR1 might be involved in responses to both biotic and abiotic stresses in pepper plants.},

abstract={In a past article, our lab described the identification and characterization of a novel vegetative MADS-box gene from quaking aspen trees, Populus tremuloides MADS-box 5 (PTM5). PTM5 was shown to be a member of the SOC1/TM3 class of MADS-box genes with a seasonal expression pattern specific to developing vascular tissues including the vascular cambium, the precursor to all woody branches, stems, and roots. Since the proper function of MADS-box proteins is dependent on specific interactions with other regulatory proteins, we further examined PTM5 protein-protein interactions as a means to better understand its function. Through yeast two-hybrid analyses, it was demonstrated that, like other SOC1/TM3 class proteins, PTM5 is capable of interacting with itself as well as other MADS-box proteins from aspen. In addition, yeast two-hybrid library screening revealed that PTM5 interacts with two non-MADS proteins, an actin depolymerizing factor (PtADF) and a novel leucine-rich repeat protein (PtLRR). In situ RNA localization was used to verify the overlapping expression patterns of these genes, and transgenic studies showed that over-expression of PTM5 in aspen causes alterations in root vasculature and root biomass development consistent with the cell growth and expansion functions of related ADF and LRR genes. These results suggest that the interaction of vegetative MADS-box genes with specific protein cofactors is a key step in the mechanisms that control woody tissue development in trees. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Increasing efforts are being invested in the construction of nanostructures with desired shapes and physical and chemical properties. Our strategy involves nanostructure design using naturally occurring protein building blocks. Inspection of the protein structural database (PDB) reveals the richness of the conformations, shapes, and chemistries of proteins and their building blocks. To increase the population of the native fold in the selected building block, we mutate natural residues by engineered, constrained residues that restrict the conformational freedom at the targeted site and have favorable interactions, geometry, and size. Here, as a model system, we construct nanotubes using building blocks from left-handed β-helices which are commonly occurring repeat protein architectures. We pick two-turn β-helical segments, duplicate and stack them, and using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations (MD) with explicit solvent probe the structural stability of these nanotubular structures as indicated by their capacity to retain the initial organization and their conformational dynamics. Comparison of the results for the wild-type and mutated sequences shows that the introduction of the conformationally restricted 1-aminocyclopropanecarboxylic acid (Ac3c) residue in loop regions greatly enhances the stability of β-helix nanotubes. The Ac3c geometrical confinement effect is sequence-specific and position-specific. The achievement of high stability of nanotubular structures originates not only from the reduction of mobility at the mutation site induced by Ac3c but also from stabilizing association forces between building blocks such as hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts. For the selected synthetic residue, similar size, hydrophobicity, and backbone conformational tendencies are desirable as in the Ac3c. © 2007 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Background: Solenoid repeat proteins of the Tetratrico Peptide Repeat (TPR) family are involved as scaffolds in a broad range of protein-protein interactions. Several resources are available for the prediction of TPRs, however, they often fail to detect divergent repeat units. Results: We have developed TPRpred, a profile-based method which uses a P-value-dependent score offset to include divergent repeat units and which exploits the tendency of repeats to occur in tandem. TPRpred detects not only TPR-like repeats, but also the related Pentatrico Peptide Repeats (PPRs) and SEL1-like repeats. The corresponding profiles were generated through iterative searches, by varying the threshold parameters for inclusion of repeat units into the profiles, and the best profiles were selected based on their performance on proteins of known structure. We benchmarked the performance of TPRpred in detecting TPR-containing proteins and in delineating the individual repeats therein, against currently available resources. Conclusion: TPRpred per forms significantly better in detecting divergent repeats in TPR-containing proteins, and finds more individual repeats than the existing methods.

DNA sequence analyses of the clones identified revealed significant homology to known plant genes and proteins reported in public databases, namely a 14-3-3 protein, a zinc-finger protein, a lipoxygenase, a flavonol synthase, a WD-40 repeat protein, a protein disulphide isomerase, an l-allo-threonine aldolase, an anthranilate N-hydroxycinnamoyl/benzoyltransferase, an homologue to a phototropic-response protein, a known apple allergen (Mal d1), two CTP synthase clones, an IAA-amidohydrolase and a calcium-binding EF hand protein. These proteins can be associated to biological processes like lipid metabolism, secondary metabolism, signal transduction, gene transcription and RNA metabolism, stress responses or defense. Still, for some of the clones, this is the first report in which they are associated with ripening. Even so, the homology found with previously described proteins allows disclosing possible biochemical roles for the proteins putatively encoded by these gene families and their putative significance in apple ripening is discussed. The results provide a contribution to better characterise the changes in gene expression that accompanies the ripening process in apple; a specie which lacks information about the molecular regulation of ripening. © 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

abstract={We are interested in the problem of grouping families of non-alignable protein sequences, such as circular-permutation, multidomain and tandem-repeat proteins, into clusters (classes) of related biological functions. For such sequences, whose numbers are constantly growing, the commonly used alignment-dependent approaches fail to yield biologically plausible results. To the best of our knowledge, no automatic process yet exists to carry out clustering on these proteins. Biologists often use more complex manual approaches based on secondary and tertiary structures, which require considerably more resources and time. In this paper, we develop a new similarity measure SMS, applied directly on non-aligned sequences. It allows us to develop a new and original alignment-free algorithm, named CLUSS, for clustering protein families based on a spectral decomposition approach inspired by the latent semantic analysis (LSA) widely used in information retrieval. CLUSS, utilized jointly with SMS, is effective on both alignable and non-alignable protein sequences. To show this, we have extensively tested our algorithm on different benchmark protein databases and families; we have also compared its performance with many alignment-dependent mainstream algorithms. The source code, the application server, and all experimental results are available at CLUSS web site http://prospectus.usherbrooke.ca/CLUSS/.},

abstract={Solenoid proteins, which are distinguished from general globular proteins by their modular architectures, are frequently involved in signal transduction pathways. Proteins from the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) and Sel1-like repeat (SLR) families share similar α-helical conformations but different consensus sequence lengths and superhelical topologies. Both families are characterized by low sequence similarity levels, rendering the identification of functional homologous difficult. Therefore current knowledge of the molecular and cellular functions of the SLR proteins Sel1, Hrd3, Chs4, Nif1, PodJ, ExoR, AlgK, HcpA, Hsp12, EnhC, LpnE, MotX, and MerG has been reviewed. Although SLR proteins possess different cellular functions they all seem to serve as adaptor proteins for the assembly of macromolecular complexes. Sel1, Hrd3, Hsp12 and LpnE are activated under cellular stress. The eukaryotic Sel1 and Hrd3 proteins are involved in the ER-associated protein degradation, whereas the bacterial LpnE, EnhC, HcpA, ExoR, and AlgK proteins mediate the interactions between bacterial and eukaryotic host cells. LpnE and EnhC are responsible for the entry of L. pneumophila into epithelial cells and macrophages. ExoR from the symbiotic microorganism S. melioti and AlgK from the pathogen P. aeruginosa regulate exopolysaccaride synthesis. Nif1 and Chs4 from yeast are responsible for the regulation of mitosis and septum formation during cell division, respectively, and PodJ guides the cellular differentiation during the cell cycle of the bacterium C. crescentus. Taken together the SLR motif establishes a link between signal transduction pathways from eukaryotes and bacteria. The SLR motif is so far absent from archaea. Therefore the SLR could have developed in the last common ancestor between eukaryotes and bacteria. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The tails of core histones (H2A, H2B, H3 and H4) are critical for the regulation of chromatin dynamics. Each core histone tail is specifically recognized by various tail binding proteins. Here we screened for budding yeast histone H4-tail binding proteins in a protein differential display approach by twodimensional gel electrophoresis (2DGE). To obtain highly enriched chromatin proteins, we used a Mg 2+-dependent chromatin oligomerization technique. The Mg 2+-dependent oligomerized chromatin from H4-tail deleted cells was compared with that from wild-type cells. We used mass spectrometry to identify 22 candidate proteins whose amounts were reduced in the oligomerized chromatin from the H4-tail deleted cells. A Saccharomyces Genome Database search revealed 10 protein complexes, each of which contained more than two candidate proteins. Interestingly, 7 out of the 10 complexes have the potential to associate with the H4-tail. We obtained in vivo evidence, by a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, that one of the candidate proteins, Pwp1p, associates with the 25S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) chromatin in an H4-tail-dependent manner. We propose that the complex containing Pwp1p regulates the transcription of rDNA. Our results demonstrate that the protein differential display approach by 2DGE, using a histone-tail mutant, is a powerful method to identify histone-tail binding proteins. © 2006 The Author(s).},

abstract={A new class of organellar proteins, characterized by pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) motifs, has been identified in plants. These proteins contain multiple 35-amino acid repeats that are proposed to form a super helix capable of binding a strand of RNA. All PPR proteins characterized to date appear to be involved in RNA processing pathways in organelles. Twenty-three PPR proteins have been identified in Trypanosoma brucei and database research indicates that most of these proteins are predicted to contain the traditional mitochondrial target sequence. Orthologues of each of the 23 proteins have also been identified in Leishmania major and Trypanosoma cruzi, indicating that these proteins represent a highly conserved class of proteins within the kinetoplastid family. Preliminary experiments using RNAi to specifically silence one identified PPR gene (TbPPRl- Tb927.2.3180), indicate that cells depleted of TbPPRl transcripts show a slow growth phenotype and altered mitochondrial maxicircle RNA profiles. This initial characterization suggests that PPR proteins will play important roles in the complex RNA processing required for mitochondrial gene expression in trypanosomes. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={In the unicellular eukaryotic green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii , several circadian rhythms have been physiologically well characterised. Recently, the entire nuclear, chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes of this alga have been sequenced, and about 200 000 expressed sequence tags have been created. Therefore, functional proteomics of the circadian system has been initiated and has resulted in the identification of novel components of the circadian system (a protein disulfide isomerase and a tetratricopeptide repeat protein). Furthermore, comparative analysis of the C. reinhardtii genome with known clock-related genes from other model organisms reveals that some photoreceptors and especially clock-related kinases and phosphatases are well conserved in C. reinhardtii . Several circadian expressed genes have been identified in C. reinhardtii , whose temporal expression is controlled at the transcriptional level. Also, a circadian RNA-binding protein (CHLAMY 1) has been characterised. It represents a novel type of RNA-binding protein and mediates circadian control at the post-transcriptional level. Its circadian binding activity appears to be controlled by differential multi-protein complexes. © 2006 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={Background: Genome wide and cross species comparisons of amino acid repeats is an intriguing problem in biology mainly due to the highly polymorphic nature and diverse functions of amino acid repeats. Innate protein repeats constitute vital functional and structural regions in proteins. Repeats are of great consequence in evolution of proteins, as evident from analysis of repeats in different organisms. In the post genomic era, availability of protein sequences encoded in different genomes provides a unique opportunity to perform large scale comparative studies of amino acid repeats. ProtRepeatsDB http://bioinfo.icgeb.res.in/ repeats/ is a relational database of perfect and mismatch repeats, access to which is designed as a resource and collection of tools for detection and cross species comparisons of different types of amino acid repeats. Description: ProtRepeatsDB (v1.2) consists of perfect as well as mismatch amino acid repeats in the protein sequences of 141 organisms, the genomes of which are now available. The web interface of ProtRepeatsDB consists of different tools to perform repeat s; based on protein IDs, organism name, repeat sequences, and keywords as in FASTA headers, size, frequency, gene ontology (GO) annotation IDs and regular expressions (REGEXP) describing repeats. These tools also allow formulation of a variety of simple, complex and logical queries to facilitate mining and large-scale cross-species comparisons of amino acid repeats. In addition to this, the database also contains sequence analysis tools to determine repeats in user input sequences. Conclusion: ProtRepeatsDB is a multi-organism database of different types of amino acid repeats present in proteins. It integrates useful tools to perform genome wide queries for rapid screening and identification of amino acid repeats and facilitates comparative and evolutionary studies of the repeats. The database is useful for identification of species or organism specific repeat markers, interspecies variations and polymorphism. © 2006 Kalita et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={HHrep is a web server for the de novo identification of repeats in protein sequences, which is based on the pairwise comparison of profile hidden Markov models (HMMs). Its main strength is its sensitivity, allowing it to detect highly divergent repeat units in protein sequences whose repeats could as yet only be detected from their structures. Examples include sequences with β-propellor fold, ferredoxin-like fold, double psi barrels or (βα)8 (TIM) barrels. We illustrate this with proteins from four superfamilies of TIM barrels by revealing a clear 4- and 8-fold symmetry, which we detect solely from their sequences. This symmetry might be the trace of an ancient origin through duplication of a βαβα or βα unit. HHrep can be accessed at http:// hhrep.tuebingen.mpg.de. © The Author 2006.

abstract={Kettin is a large actin-binding protein with immunoglobulin-like (Ig) repeats, which is associated with the thin filaments in arthropod muscles. Here, we report identification and functional characterization of kettin in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We found that one of the monoclonal antibodies that were raised against C. elegans muscle proteins specifically reacts with kettin (Ce-kettin). We determined the entire cDNA sequence of Ce-kettin that encodes a protein of 472 kDa with 31 Ig repeats. Arthropod kettins are splice variants of much larger connectin/titin-related proteins. However, the gene for Ce-kettin is independent of other connectin/titin-related genes. Ce-kettin localizes to the thin filaments near the dense bodies in both striated and nonstriated muscles. The C-terminal four Ig repeats and the adjacent non-Ig region synergistically bind to actin filaments in vitro. RNA interference of Ce-kettin caused weak disorganization of the actin filaments in body wall muscle. This phenotype was suppressed by inhibiting muscle contraction by a myosin mutation, but it was enhanced by tetramisole-induced hypercontraction. Furthermore, Ce-kettin was involved in organizing the cytoplasmic portion of the dense bodies in cooperation with α-actinin. These results suggest that kettin is an important regulator of myofibrillar organization and provides mechanical stability to the myofibrils during contraction. © 2006 by The American Society for Cell Biology.},

abstract={Deoxyhypusine hydroxylase (DOHH) catalyzes the final step in the post-translational synthesis of hypusine (Nε-(4-amino-2- hydroxybutyl) lysine) in eIF5A. DOHH is a HEAT-repeat protein with eight tandem helical hairpins in a symmetrical dyad. It contains two potential iron coordination sites (one on each dyad) composed of two strictly conserved His-Glu motifs. The purified human recombinant DOHH was amixture of active holoenzyme containing 2mol of iron/mol of DOHH and inactive metal-free apoenzyme. The two species could be distinguished by their different mobilities upon native gel electrophoresis. The DOHH apoenzyme exhibited markedly reduced levels of iron and activity. DOHH activity could be restored only by the addition of Fe 2+ to the apoenzyme but not by other metals including Cd 2+, Co2+, Cr2+, Cu2+, Mg 2+, Mn2+, Ni2+, and Zn2+. The role of the strictly conserved His-Glu residues was evaluated by site-directed mutagenesis. Substitution of any single amino acid in the four His-Glu motifs with alanine abolished the enzyme activity. Of these eight alanine substitutions, six, including H56A, H89A, E90A, H207A, H240A, and E241A, caused a severe reduction in the iron content. Our results provide strong evidence that Fe(II) is the active-site-bound metal critical for DOHH catalysis and that the strictly conserved His-Glu motifs are essential for iron binding and catalysis. Furthermore, the iron to DOHH stoichiometry and dependence of iron binding on each of the four conserved His-Glu motifs suggest a binuclear iron mediated reaction mechanism, distinct from that of other Fe(II)-dependent protein hydroxylases, such as prolyl 4-hydroxylase or lysyl hydroxylases.},

abstract={We describe here the rapid selection of specific MAP-kinase binders from a combinatorial library of designed ankyrin repeat proteins (DARPins). A combined in vitro/in vivo selection approach, based on ribosome display and the protein fragment complementation assay (PCA), yielded a large number of different binders that are fully functional in the cellular cytoplasm. Ribosome-display selection pools of four successive selection rounds were examined to monitor the enrichment of JNK2-specific DARPins. Surprisingly, only one round of ribosome display with subsequent PCA selection of this pool was necessary to isolate a first specific binder with micromolar affinity. After only two rounds of ribosome-display selection followed by PCA, virtually all DARPins showed JNK2-specific binding, with affinities in the low nanomolar range. The enrichment factor of ribosome display thus approaches 105 per round. In a second set of experiments, similar results were obtained with the kinases JNK1 and p38 as targets. Again, almost all investigated DARPins obtained after two rounds of ribosome display showed specific binding to the targets used, JNK1 or p38. In all three selection experiments the identified DARPins possess very high specificity for the target kinase. Taken together, the combination of ribosome display and PCA selections allowed the identification of large pools of binders at unparalleled speed. Furthermore, DARPins are applicable in intracellular selections and immunoprecipitations from the extract of eukaryotic cells. © The Author 2006. Published by Oxford University Press.

abstract={The broad-spectrum rice blast resistance gene Pi9 was cloned using a map-based cloning strategy. Sequencing of a 76-kb bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) contig spanning the Pi9 locus led to identification of six tandemly arranged resistance-like genes with a nucleotide-binding site (NBS) and leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) (Nbs1-Pi9-Nbs6-Pi9). Analysis of selected Pi9 deletion mutants and transformation of a 45-kb fragment from the BAC contig into the susceptible rice cultivar TP309 narrowed down Pi9 to the candidate genes Nbs2-Pi9 and Nbs3-Pi9. Disease evaluation of the transgenic lines carrying the individual candidate genes confirmed that Nbs2-Pi9 is the Pi9 gene. Sequence comparison analysis revealed that the six paralogs at the Pi9 locus belong to four classes and gene duplication might be one of the major evolutionary forces contributing to the formation of the NBS-LRR gene cluster. Semiquantitative reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR analysis showed that Pi9 was constitutively expressed in the Pi9-resistant plants and was not induced by blast infection. The cloned Pi9 gene provides a starting point to elucidate the molecular basis of the broadspectrum disease resistance and the evolutionary mechanisms of blast resistance gene clusters in rice.

abstract={Based on sequence similarity search and domain detection, nine ACT domain repeat protein-coding genes (the "ACR" genes) in rice were identified, which were mainly distributed on the chromosomes 2, 3, 4, and 8. An InterPro database search indicated that four copies of the ACT domain linearly occupied the entire polypeptide. The first three ACT domains were linked by two different sequences. However, the fourth ACT domain was extremely close to ACT3. Gene structure comparisons showed large differences in exon numbers, from three to eight, among members of the rice ACR gene family. In addition, it appeared that gene duplication might be operative when the compositions of exons and introns were analyzed. Phylogenetic analysis divided the ACR gene family into five distinct groups, and this division was generally according to the expression patterns of the ACR genes. The Arabidopsis and rice ACR proteins were clustered across together, suggesting that these ACR genes might originate from an ancient common ancestor. Notably, the identification of orthologues and paralogues would be useful for rice gene functional annotation. © 2005 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.},

abstract={In this research, one 1156 bp cDNA containing full open reading frame and encoding a novel 24-kDa protein with four tandem WD repeat motifs was cloned from cotton, therefore was named GhWDR and the GenBank accession number is AY870657. By search of GhWDR cDNA and amino acid sequences in the database, we found that GhWDR and OSJNBa0003G23.2 from Oryza sativa show 90% sequence identity and 84% identity to WD-repeat protein from Arabidopsis thaliana , and also has high sequence identity to other WD repeat proteins, most of which are similar to Pop3 from fission yeast (accession number T39922) and Lst8p from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (accession number NP014392). Therefore, we proposed that GhWDR could act in some cellular processes as pop3 or LST8 does. In addition, the expression of GhWDR in various tissues was studied by RT-PCR, and it is expressed in all of the studied tissues, but the level of expression is low in the leaves when compared to that of other tissues. © 2006 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={Repeat proteins were first identified because of their unusual primary structure, in which short amino acid sequences, typically between 20 and 40 residues, are repeated in tandem, often many times. After identification at the sequence level, the three-dimensional structures of representatives from several classes (e.g., ankyrin, tetratricopeptide, leucine rich repeat) have been solved. The structures indeed reveal unusual, nonglobular structures, a linear "string" of the tandem motifs. Perhaps because of the large surface area that is presented as a consequence of such elongated structures, repeat domains are often involved in mediating protein-protein interactions. Here we udescribe methods of consensus-based design and engineering of repeat proteins. We pay particular attention to the attributes of repeat proteins that make them well-suited to such approaches. In addition, we discuss practical issues related to producing and characterizing such designed proteins. We use the tetratricopeptide repeat, which is well-studied in our group, to illustrate many ideas, but also draw comparisons to other work on repeat proteins, where relevant.},

abstract={The glass-like transparency of the human eye lens is achieved by the tight packing of abundant crystallin proteins. However, the precise role of the accessory non-crystallin proteins is not well understood. We have carried out 2-DE mapping of these proteins in rat lens. This showed the presence of the high molecular weight filamentous structural proteins spectrin, filensin, tubulin, vimentin, actin and phakinin as well as several forms of potential crystallin oligomers comprised of αA, βB1, βA1 and βA4 chains. Other proteins that were present include, heat shock protein 71, WD repeat protein 1, and several enzymes including α-enolase, pyruvate kinase, transketolase and aldose reductase. 2-D-DIGE analysis revealed several expression differences between the lens proteomes of male and female rats. Female rat lenses contained lower levels of aldose reductase, increased proteolyic fragments of the structural proteins filensin, vimentin and phakinin and higher levels of potential αA, βB1 and βA1 crystallin oligomers. Taken together these findings suggest that there are potential differences in oxidative stress regulation between male and female rat lenses, which may have implications on susceptibility to cataract formation. Future studies aimed at elucidating pre-cataractic changes in the non-crystallin proteins described here may facilitate identification of novel markers involved in cataractogenesis. © 2006 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

abstract={In higher plants, RNA editing is a posttranscriptional process that converts C to U in organelle mRNAs. Although RNA editing in mitochondria occurs much more frequently than in chloroplasts, editing of exogenously supplied RNA substrates in vitro and in organello has shown that editing in the two organelles shares some common features. In particular, the 20 nucleotides upstream of the editing site play an important role in specifying the C to be edited. Biochemical approaches have allowed the identification of features of cis-sequences necessary for KNA editing to occur, but have failed to identify any of the components of the mitochondrial editing machinery. In order to implement a genetic approach for identification of editing factors, we have identified a polymorphism in the editing efficiency of a mitochondrial site between two ecotypes of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), Columbia (Col) and Landsberg erecta (Ler). In rosette leaves, an editing site within the ccb206 mitochondrial gene is more highly edited in Col than in Ler. Depending on the development stage and tissue analyzed, the difference in editing extent varies between the two ecotypes; for example, in floral buds, editing extent does not differ. Single-point regression analysis of the editing efficiency in a sample of recombinant inbred lines derived from a cross between Col and Ler allowed the identification of two quantitative trait loci controlling this trait. A member of the pentatricopeptide repeat protein family that carries a putative mitochondrial transit sequence has been identified near a major quantitative trait locus on chromosome 4. © 2005 American Society of Plant Biologists.},

abstract={Timeless (Tim) and Period (Per) are coordinately synthesized interacting proteins that in response to positional/environmental cues comigrate to the nucleus as obligate heterodimers where they act to suppress their own gene expression as part of the circadian rhythm network in Drosophila. There has been considerable controversy about the structural nature of Tim because of somewhat conflicting results generated by the automated threading algorithm 3D-PSSM. With use of a computer-assisted but largely manual approach, it is shown here that Tim is composed of repetitive structural elements and that those elements comprise two ARM repeat domains, validating the essence of the original 3D-PSSM prediction. Eleven individual ARM structural units are assigned, and a phylogenetic analysis showing their relatedness to one another is performed. In addition, there appears to be a small domain of prenyltransferase-like repeats C-terminal to the second ARM domain, which went undetected in previous analyses. Although we cannot know the precise conformation it adopts until a structure is solved, Tim emerges here as clearly a member of the helical repeat protein superfamily. Given its role in periodic nuclear translocation, Tim may, therefore, have a functional analogy with the photoperiod-responsive protein Phor1 and other karyopherin-like molecules. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract={Analysis of 80S ribosomes of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) by use of high-speed centrifugation, sucrose gradient fractionation, one- and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, liquid chromatography purification, and mass spectrometry (matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight and electrospray ionization) identified 74 ribosomal proteins (r-proteins), of which 73 are orthologs of rat r-proteins and one is the plant-specific r-protein P3. Thirty small (40S) subunit and 44 large (60S) subunit r-proteins were confirmed. In addition, an ortholog of the mammalian receptor for activated protein kinase C, a tryptophan-aspartic acid-domain repeat protein, was found to be associated with the 40S subunit and polysomes. Based on the prediction that each r-protein is present in a single copy, the mass of the Arabidopsis 80S ribosome was estimated as 3.2 MD (1,159 kD 40S; 2,010 kD 60S), with the 4 single-copy rRNAs (18S, 26S, 5.8S, and 5S) contributing 53% of the mass. Despite strong evolutionary conservation in r-protein composition among eukaryotes, Arabidopsis 80S ribosomes are variable in composition due to distinctions in mass or charge of approximately 25% of the r-proteins. This is a consequence of amino : acid sequence divergence within r-protein gene families and posttranslational modification of individual r-proteins (e.g. amino-terminal acetylation, phosphorylation). For example, distinct types of r-proteins S15a and P2 accumulate in ribosomes due to evolutionarily divergence of r-protein genes. Ribosome variation is also due to amino acid sequence divergence and differential phosphorylation of the carboxy terminus of r-protein S6. The role of ribosome heterogeneity in differential mRNA translation is discussed. © 2005 American Society of Plant Biologists.},

abstract={Experimental cDNA sequence determinations lag behind in silico gene structure predictions in some recently sequenced genomes. This may be due in part to low transcript abundance and/or the severely spatio-temporarily restricted expression pattern of some genes. Here we characterize the predicted repressed gene of Arabidopsis thaliana (At4g21130) that encodes a homologue of the Arabidopsis U3-55K-like protein (At4g05410) and of the U3-55K (RNU3IP2, Rrp9p) proteins from other eukaryotes. In man and yeast, U3-55K is involved in the processing of the pre-ribosomal RNA. Here we show that treatment with inhibitors of histone deacetylases (trichostatin A, sodium butyrate) or DNA methyltransferases (5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine) induces a low but distinct level of mRNA from the repressed Arabidopsis At4g21130 locus, which can be detected by RT-PCR amplification. Direct sequencing of PCR products reveals the open reading frame that differs, in part, from the hypothetical one and encodes a seven-WD-repeat protein highly conserved when compared to U3-55K proteins from various eukaryotic species. This suggests the conservation of its function. The described approach may help to determine the nucleotide sequences of transcripts from predicted genes with a low level of expression. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Changes in protein stability can be achieved by making substitutions that increase or decrease the available conformations of the unfolded protein without altering the conformational freedom of the folded protein. Matthews and coworkers (1987) proposed that proline to alanine (P→A) substitution would achieve this type of entropic destabilization. By comparing the Ramachandran area associated with alanine and proline residues, Matthews et al. estimated the unfolding entropy change resulting from P→A substitution to be 4.8 cal mol-1 K-1. Although such an entropy difference would produce a substantial free energy change, accurately resolving such free energy changes into entropic and enthalpic components has been difficult. Here, we attempt to quantify the unfolding entropy change produced by P→A substitution by amplifying the effect through multiple substitutions, and by decreasing the uncertainty in determining the unfolding entropy. Variants of a repeat protein, the Drosophila Notch ankyrin domain, were constructed with a varying number of P→A substitutions at structurally conserved positions. Unfolding entropy values of the variants were determined from free energy measurements taken over a common temperature range using chemical denaturation. Our findings confirm the prediction that increasing the number of proline residues present in similar local environments increases the unfolding entropy. The average value of this increase in unfolding entropy is 7.7±4.2 cal mol-1 K-1, which is within error of the value estimated by Matthews et al. (1987). Copyright © 2005 The Protein Society.},

abstract={Eighteen human histone deacetylases (HDACs) have been identified, and according to their sequence similarity to yeast homologs, these enzymes are grouped into distinct classes. Within class II, HDAC4, HDAC5, HDAC7, and HDAC9 share similar domain organization both within the N-terminal extension and the C-terminal catalytic domain, thus forming a subclass known as class IIa. These HDACs function as signal-responsive transcriptional corepressors. To gain further insight into their function and regulation, we utilized an N-terminal fragment of HDAC4 as bait in yeast two-hybrid screens, which uncovered myocyte enhancer factor 2C, 14-3-3ζ, and ankyrin repeat family A protein (ANKRA). ANKRA is a poorly characterized protein with an ankyrin repeat domain similar to RFXANK, a subunit of the trimeric transcription factor RFX. Mutations on genes of the RFX subunits and the coactivator CIITA are responsible for the bare lymphocyte syndrome, an immunodeficiency disorder attributed to the lack of major histocompatibility complex class II (MHCII) antigens. Through its ankyrin repeat domain, RFXANK interacted with HDAC4. Two RFXANK-binding sites were found on HDAC4 with one located within residues 118-279 and another within residues 448-666. Interestingly, this deacetylase also interacted with CIITA. Consistent with the physical interaction with RFXANK and CIITA, HDAC4 and homologs repressed MHCII expression. These results identify ANKRA, RFXANK, and CIITA as novel targets of class IIa HDACs and suggest that these deacetylases play a role in regulating MHCII expression. © 2005 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

abstract={Despite recent progress, the precise mechanisms responsible for vertebrate cardiac development are still enigmatic. Better understanding of cardiac biology and disease necessitates identification and analysis of a full spectrum of regulatory and structural proteins specific to the developing heart. By performing an in silico screen, we identified a cardiac-specific gene we named Serdin1. The Serdin1 gene is conserved, and the message is restricted to the heart in several vertebrate species, thus implicating Serdin1 as an important gene in cardiac development. In situ hybridization confirmed that the Serdin1 message is cardiac-specific in mice as early as embryonic day 8.5. Antibody staining demonstrated predominantly nuclear staining in immortalized cardiac cell lines (P19 and HL-1) and proliferating cultured cardiomyocytes, whereas in vivo SERDIN1 localizes to I bands of the sarcomere. Seven kilobases of the upstream regulatory sequence of Serdin1 is sufficient for cardiac-specific expression. Computer analysis revealed an 80-bp homologous region between the mouse and the human Serdin genes that contains GATA, SRF, and MEF sites. Cardiac specificity and localization patterns suggest that SERDIN1 is intimately integrated with the molecular pathways controlling cardiogenesis in vertebrates. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

We generated NLRR4-deficient (NLRR4-/-) mice and found that they showed impaired memory retention. In hippocampus-dependent learning tasks, NLRR4-/- mice were able to learn and maintain the memories for one day but unable to retain the memories for four days after learning. In contrast, in a hippocampus-independent task, NLRR4-/- mice were able to retain the memory normally for at least seven days.

abstract={Ezrin, a linker between plasma membrane and actin cytoskeleton possesses morphogenic properties and can promote dissemination of tumor cells. Ezrin is phosphorylated on tyrosine, but a detailed picture of the signaling pathways involved in this modification is lacking. The transforming tyrosine kinase Src has various cytoskeletal substrates and is involved in regulation of cellular adhesion. We studied the role of Src in tyrosine phosphorylation of ezrin in adherent cells. We show that ezrin is phosphorylated in human embryonic kidney 293 cells in a Src family-dependent way. In SYF cells lacking Src, Yes, and Fyn, ezrin was not tyrosine-phosphorylated but reintroduction of wild-type Src followed by Src activation or introduction of active Src restored phosphorylation. Mapping of the Src-catalyzed tyrosine in vitro and in vivo by site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated Tyr477 as the primary target residue. We generated a pTyr477-phosphospecific antibody, which confirmed that Tyr477 becomes phosphorylated in cells in a Src-dependent manner. Tyr477 phosphorylation did not affect ezrin head-to-tail association or phosphorylation of ezrin on threonine 566, indicating that the function of Tyr477 phosphorylation is not related to the intramolecular regulation of ezrin. A modified yeast two-hybrid screen in which ezrin bait was phosphorylated by Src identified a novel interaction with a kelch-repeat protein family member, KBTBD2 (Kelch-repeat and BTB/ POZ domain containing 2). The Src dependence of the interaction was further verified by affinity precipitation assays. Identification of a functional interplay with Src opens novel avenues for further characterization of the biological activities of ezrin. © 2005 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

abstract={We report the protein isolation, cloning and characterization of members of an unusual protein family, which comprise the most abundant proteins present in the squid eye. The proteins in this family have a range of molecular weights from 32 to 36 kDa. Electron microscopy and detergent solubilization demonstrate that these proteins are tightly associated with membrane structures where they may form tetramers. Despite this, these proteins have no stretches of hydrophobic residues that could form typical transmembrane domains. They share an unusual protein sequence rich in methionine, and contain multiple repeating motifs. We have therefore named these proteins Methionine-Rich Repeat Proteins (MRRPs). The use of structure prediction algorithms suggest very little recognized secondary structure elements. At the time of cloning no sequence or structural homologues have been found in any database. We have isolated three closely related cDNA clones from the MRRP family. Coupled in vitro transcription/translation of the MRRP clones shows that they encode proteins with molecular masses similar to components of native MRRPs. Immunoblot analysis of these proteins reveals that they are also present in squid brain, optic lobe, and heart, and also indicate that MRRP-like protein motifs may also exist in mammalian tissues. We propose that MRRPs define a family of important proteins that have an unusual mode of attachment or insertion into cell membranes and are found in evolutionarily diverse organisms. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Myostatin belongs to the transforming growth factor beta superfamily and has been shown to function as an inhibitor of skeletal muscle proliferation and differentiation. To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms of myostatin function during myogenesis, differential display reverse transcription PCR was employed to identify altered gene expressions associated with myostatin inhibitory function in chicken fetal myoblasts (CFMs). In this work, we have identified seven up-regulated and 12 down-regulated genes in myostatin stimulated CFMs. Those genes are involved in myogenic differentiation, cell architecture, energy metabolism, signal transduction, and apoptosis. The down-regulation of muscle creatine kinase B, troponin C, and myosin regulatory light chain is in agreement with the myostatin negative role in myocyte differentiation. In addition, the expression alteration of skeletal muscle-specific cardiac ankyrin repeat protein and the bcl-2 related anti-apoptotic protein Nr-13 suggests possible unique roles for myostatin in regulating myogenesis by controlling cofactors participated transcriptional regulation and apoptosis. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression in animals and plants. Comparative genomic computational methods have been developed to predict new miRNAs in worms, flies, and humans. Here, we present a novel single genome approach for the detection of miRNAs in Arabidopsis thaliana. This was initiated by producing a candidate miRNA-target data set using an algorithm called findMiRNA, which predicts potential miRNAs within candidate precursor sequences that have corresponding target sites within transcripts. From this data set, we used a characteristic divergence pattern of miRNA precursor families to select 13 potential new miRNAs for experimental verification, and found that corresponding small RNAs could be detected for at least eight of the candidate miRNAs. Expression of some of these miRNAs appears to be under developmental control. Our results are consistent with the idea that targets of miRNAs encompass a wide range of transcripts, including those for F-box factors, ubiquitin conjugases, Leucine-rich repeat proteins, and metabolic enzymes, and that regulation by miRNAs might be widespread in the genome. The entire set of annotated transcripts in the Arabidopsis genome has been run through findMiRNA to yield a data set that will enable identification of potential miRNAs directed against any target gene. © 2005 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.},

abstract={We used mRNA differential display to identify new genes induced early after exposure to insulin. Our screening strategy was based on the comparison of gene expression during the time course of insulin induction in the liver of 12-day-old suckling rats both in vivo and in vitro. A novel, early induced transcript, EIIH, was identified that encodes a 353-amino-acid protein with several features suggesting that it may be secreted or bound to membranes. EIIH is also distantly related to a variety of LRR (leucine-rich repeat) proteins. Insulin treatment increased EIIH mRNA levels in the hepatocytes of suckling, fasted adult and STZ (streptozotocin)-treated diabetic rats, where insulin was required to maintain the basal level of EIIH expression. EIIH expression was induced during the suckling/weaning transition, and remained detectable thereafter. Tissue distribution analysis in adult rats revealed a pattern of expression mainly in the liver, intestine and islets of Langerhans, closely following that of the Glut2 (glucose transporter 2), suggesting that it may play a role in carbohydrate metabolism. EIIH may be a primary target of the transcriptional regulation by insulin, and may therefore constitute a new model to study the mechanisms by which insulin acts on gene transcription.},

abstract={A large gene family encoding proteins with a pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) motif exists in flowering plants but not in algae, fungi, or animals. This suggests that PPR protein genes expanded vastly during the evolution of the land plants. To investigate this possibility, we analysed PPR protein genes in the basal land plant, the moss Physcomitrella patens. An extensive survey of the Physcomitrella expressed sequence tag (EST) databases revealed 36 ESTs encoding PPR proteins. This indicates that a large gene family of PPR proteins originated before the divergence of the vascular plant and moss lineages. We also characterized five full-length cDNAs encoding PPR proteins, designated PPR513-10, PPR566-6, PPR868-14, PPR986-12, and PPR423-6. Intracellular localization analysis demonstrated two PPR proteins in chloroplasts (cp), whereas the cellular localization of the other three PPR proteins is unclear. The genes of the cp-localized PPR513-10 and PPR566-6 were expressed differentially in protonemata grown under different light-dark conditions, suggesting they have distinctive functions in cp.

abstract={WD40 repeat proteins play important roles in a variety of cellular functions, including cell growth, proliferation, apoptosis, and intracellular signal transduction. Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are evolutionary conserved enzymes in cell signal transduction connecting cell-surface receptors to critical regulatory targets within cells and control cell survival, adaptation, and proliferation. Previous studies revealed that G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) play important roles in the signal transduction from extracellular stimuli to MAPKs and the WD40-containing Gβ proteins as well as Gβ-like proteins are involved in the stimulation and regulation of the MAPK signaling pathways. Here we report the identification and characterization of a novel human WD40 repeat protein, WD40 repeat protein 26 (WDR26). The cDNA of WDR26 is 3,729 bp, encoding a Gβ-like protein of 514 amino acids in the cytoplasm. The protein is highly conserved in evolution across different species from yeast, Drosophila, mouse, to human. Northern blot analysis indicates that WDR26 is expressed in most of the examined human tissues, especially at a high level in skeletal muscle. Overexpression of WDR26 in the cell inhibits the transcriptional activities of ETS proteins, ELK-1 and c-fos serum response element (SRE), mediated by MEKK1. These results suggest that WDR26 may act as a negative regulator in MAPK signaling pathway and play an important role in cell signal transduction. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract={A yeast-two-hybrid screen was used to investigate the interaction controlled by resistance gene RPS2 of Arabidopsis thaliana and avirulence gene avrRpt2 of Pseudomonas syringae. Twelve Arabidopsis proteins that physically interact with RPS2 in yeast were identified. Four of these were studied further including a calmodulin, a putative ankyrin/tetratricopeptide repeat-containing protein, a protein with a nuclear localization domain, and a protein of unknown function. In yeast, all four interacted with RPS2 and not with a related resistance protein, RPM1. Three of the four interacted solely with N-terminal domains of RPS2 and not with the RPS2 LRR domain. Interactions were not impacted by RPS2 nucleotide binding site mutations. When disease resistance was tested in Arabidopsis, plant lines carrying T-DNA insertions that disrupt the genes for the ankyrin/tetratricopeptide repeat protein or the protein of unknown function exhibited reduced resistance to P. syringae pv. tomato strain DC3000 expressing avrRpt2.

abstract={The rice (Oryza sativa) spotted leaf11 (spl11) mutant was identified from an ethyl methanesulfonate-mutagenized indica cultivar IR68 population and was previously shown to display a spontaneous cell death phenotype and enhanced resistance to rice fungal and bacterial pathogens. Here, we have isolated Spl11 via a map-based cloning strategy. The isolation of the Spl11 gene was facilitated by the identification of three additional spl11 alleles from an IR64 mutant collection. The predicted SPL11 protein contains both a U-box domain and an armadillo (ARM) repeat domain, which were demonstrated in yeast and mammalian systems to be involved in ubiquitination and protein-protein interactions, respectively. Amino acid sequence comparison indicated that the similarity between SPL11 and other plant U-box-ARM proteins is mostly restricted to the U-box and ARM repeat regions. A single base substitution was detected in spl11, which results in a premature stop codon in the SPL11 protein. Expression analysis indicated that Spl11 is induced in both incompatible and compatible rice-blast interactions. In vitro ubiquitination assay indicated that the SPL11 protein possesses E3 ubiquitin ligase activity that is dependent on an intact U-box domain, suggesting a role of the ubiquitination system in the control of plant cell death and defense. © 2004 American Society of Plant Biologists.},

abstract={Complement control proteins (CCPs) contain repeated protein domains, short consensus repeats (SCRs), which must be relevant to diverse functions such as complement activation, coagulation, viral binding, fetal implantation, and self-non-self recognition. Although SCRs share some discontinuous and imperfect motifs, there are many variable positions and indels making classification in subfamilies extremely difficult. Using domain-by-domain phylogenetic analysis, we have found that most domains can be classified into only 11 subfamilies, designated a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, or k and identified by critical residues. Each particular CCP is characterized by the order of representatives of the subfamilies. Human complement receptor 1 (CR1) has ajefbkd repeated four times and followed by ch. The classification crosses CCPs and indicates that a particular CCP is a function of the mix of SCRs. The aje set is a feature of several CCPs including human CR1 and DAF and murine Crry and appears to be associated with the success or failure of implantation inter alia. This approach facilitates genomic analysis of available sequences and suggests a framework for the evolution of CCPs. Units of duplication range from single SCRs, to septamers such as efbkdaj, to extensive segments such as MCP-CR1L. Imperfections of duplication with subsequent deletion have contributed to diversification.},

AIP1 also caps the barbed end of ADF/cofilin-bound actin filament. However, the mechanism by which AIP1 interacts with ADF/cofilin and actin is not clearly understood. We determined the crystal structure of Caenorhabditis elegans AIP1 (UNC-78), which revealed 14 WD40 modules arranged in two seven-bladed β-propeller domains. The structure allowed for the mapping of conserved surface residues, and mutagenesis studies identified five residues that affected the ADF/cofilin-dependent actin filament disassembly activity. Mutations of these residues, which reside in blades 3 and 4 in the N-terminal propeller domain, had significant effects on the disassembly activity but did not alter the barbed end capping activity. These data support a model in which this conserved surface of AIP1 plays a direct role in enhancing fragmentation/depolymerization of ADF/cofilin-bound actin filaments but not in barbed end capping.},

Characterization of the folding and assembly pathways suggests that ankyrin repeat domains generally undergo a two-state folding transition despite their modular structure. Also, the large number of available sequences has allowed the ankyrin repeat to be used as a template for consensus-based protein design. Such projects have been successful in revealing positions responsible for structure and function in the ankyrin repeat as well as creating a potential universal scaffold for molecular recognition.},

abstract={The CALRR1 gene, expressed in pepper leaves following infection by Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria, encodes a secreted leucine-rich repeat (LRR) with five tandem repeats of a 24-amino-acid LRR motif. Northern blot analyses revealed that CALRR1 is not constitutively expressed in pepper plants, but is strongly induced upon the infection by X. campestris pv. vesicatoria, Phytophthora capsici, Colletotrichum coccodes and Colletotrichum gloeosporioides on leaves. CALRR1 was not systemically induced in upper leaves by bacterial infection. The inoculation of bacterial live cells, and treatment with dead cells and culture filtrates of pathogenic or nonpathogenic bacteria triggered the accumulation of CALRR1 transcripts. Treatment with signaling molecules, including salicylic acid (SA), ethylene (ET), methyl jasmonate (MeJA), DL-β-amino-n-butyric acid (BABA) and benzothiadiazole (BTH), did not activate the transcription of the CALRR1 gene, indicating that CALRR1 expression is not regulated by defense signaling pathways activated by these molecules. CALRR1 was induced by treatment with high salinity, abscisic acid (ABA) and wounding, but not by drought and cold stress. An in situ hybridization study showed that CALRR1 mRNA was localized in phloem tissues of leaves, stems, and green fruits of pepper plants during the pathogen infection and ABA exposure. The location characteristics and the spatio-temporal expression pattern of CALRR1 suggest that it may play a role in protecting phloem cells against biotic and abiotic stresses affecting phloem function. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Fruiting body development in fungi is a complex cellular differentiation process that is controlled by more than 100 developmental genes. Mutants of the filamentous fungus Sordaria macrospora showing defects in fruiting body formation are pertinent sources for the identification of components of this multicellular differentiation process. Here we show that the sterile mutant pro11 carries a defect in the pro11 gene encoding a multimodular WD40 repeat protein. Complementation analysis indicates that the wild-type gene or C-terminally truncated versions of the wild-type protein are able to restore the fertile phenotype in mutant pro11. PRO11 shows significant homology to several vertebrate WD40 proteins, such as striatin and zinedin, which seem to be involved in Ca2+-dependent signaling in cells of the central nervous system and are supposed to function as scaffolding proteins linking signaling and eukaryotic endocytosis. Cloning of a mouse cDNA encoding striatin allowed functional substitution of the wild-type protein with restoration of fertility in mutant pro11. Our data strongly suggest that an evolutionarily conserved cellular process controlling eukaryotic cell differentiation may regulate fruiting body formation.},

abstract={Multiple and variable tyrosine sulfation in extracellular class II leucine-rich repeat proteins/proteoglycans were characterized by mass spectrometry. The sulfogroup on tyrosine is labile and is released from peptides under normal mass spectrometric conditions. Thus, special approaches must be considered in order to identify this modification. By using a combination of mass spectrometry studies operating in negative and positive ion mode, tyrosine sulfation could be identified. In positive mode, the peptides normally appeared non-sulfated, whereas in negative mode a mixture of sulfated and non-sulfated species was observed. A combination of peptides released by different proteinases was used to obtain details on the locations of sulfate groups. Multiple tyrosine sulfates were observed in the N-terminal region of fibromodulin (up to 9 sites), osteoadherin (up to 6 sites), and lumican (2 sites). Osteoadherin contains two additional sulfated tyrosine residues close to its C terminus. We also identified an error in the published sequence of bovine fibromodulin, resulting in the replacement of Thr37 by Tyr37-Gly38, thus increasing its homology with its human counterpart.},

abstract={The Arabidopsis genome was searched to identify predicted proteins containing armadillo (ARM) repeats, a motif known to mediate protein-protein interactions in a number of different animal proteins. Using domain database predictions and models generated in this study, 108 Arabidopsis proteins were identified that contained a minimum of two ARM repeats with the majority of proteins containing four to eight ARM repeats. Clustering analysis showed that the 108 predicted Arabidopsis ARM repeat proteins could be divided into multiple groups with wide differences in their domain compositions and organizations. Interestingly, 41 of the 108 Arabidopsis ARM repeat proteins contained a U-box, a motif present in a family of E3 ligases, and these proteins represented the largest class of Arabidopsis ARM repeat proteins. In 14 of these U-box/ARM repeat proteins, there was also a novel conserved domain identified in the N-terminal region. Based on the phylogenetic tree, representative U-box/ARM repeat proteins were selected for further study. RNA-blot analyses revealed that these U-box/ARM proteins are expressed in a variety of tissues in Arabidopsis. In addition, the selected U-box/ARM proteins were found to be functional E3 ubiquitin ligases. Thus, these U-box/ARM proteins represent a new family of E3 ligases in Arabidopsis.},

Many kelch-repeat proteins are involved in organization of the cytoskeleton via interaction with actin and intermediate filaments, whereas BTB domains have multiple cellular roles, including recruitment to E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes. The identification of the BACK domain in BTB and kelch proteins, and its high conservation across metazoan genomes, suggest an important function for this domain with a possible role in substrate orientation in Cullin3-based E3 ligase complexes.},

abstract={To search for novel prognostic indicators, we previously cloned >2,000 novel genes from primary neuroblastoma (NBL) cDNA libraries and screened for differential expression between the subsets with favorable (stage 1 or 2 with a single copy of MYCN) and unfavorable (stage 3 or 4 with amplification of MYCN) prognosis. From them, we have identified 3 genes of human neuronal leucine-rich repeat protein (NLRR) family: Nbla10449/hNLRR-1, Nbla00061/hNLRR-2/GAC1 and Nbla10677/hNLRR-3. An additional family member, hNLRR-5, was also found by homology search against public database. NLRR family proteins have been proposed to function as a neuronal adhesion molecule or soluble ligand binding receptor like Drosophila toll and slit with multiple domains including 11 sets of extracellular leucine-rich repeat (LRR)-motifs. However, the functional role of the NLRR protein family has been elusive. Our present study shows that hNLRR mRNAs are preferentially expressed in nervous system and/or adrenal gland. In cancer cell lines, hNLRR-1, hNLRR-3 and hNLRR-5 are expressed at high levels in the neural crest-derived cells. Most remarkably, in primary NBLs, hNLRR-1 is significantly expressed at high levels in unfavorable subsets as compared to favorable ones, whereas the expression pattern of hNLRR-3 and hNLRR-5 is the opposite. In order to understand the function of these receptors, we have used newborn mouse superior cervical ganglion (SCG) cells which are dependent on nerve growth factor (NGF) for their survival. Expression of the mouse counterparts of hNLRR-2 and hNLRR-3 is up-regulated after NGF-induced differentiation and down-regulated after NGF depletion-induced apoptosis. On the other hand, expression of hNLRR-1 and hNLRR-5 is inversely regulated in the same system. These results have suggested that the regulation of the hNLRR family genes may be associated with NGF signaling pathway in both SCG cells and neuroblastoma. Our quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis using 99 primary NBLs has revealed that high levels of hNLRR-1 expression are significantly associated with older age (>1 year, p=0.0001), advanced stages (p=0.0007), low expression of TrkA (p=0.011), and MYCN amplification (p=0.0001), while those of hNLRR-3 expression are significantly correlated with the favorable prognostic indicators. Furthermore, multivariate analysis reveals that expression of hNLRR-1 is an independent prognostic indicator in human neuroblastoma. Thus, our results demonstrate that, despite being members of the same family, hNLRR-1 and hNLRR-3 may share different biological function among the NBL subsets, and that their expression level becomes novel prognostic indicators of NBL.},

abstract={Longitudinal bone growth results from coordination of proliferation and hypertrophy of chondrocytes, calcification of the matrix, vascular invasion, and completion of endochondral bone formation in the growth plate. Although proliferative and hypertrophic chondrocytes are well characterized histomorphologically, the understanding of factors governing this transition is not fully explained. Our hypothesis was that significant differential gene expression exists between proliferative and hypertrophic chondrocytes that may provide clues to the regulation of this transition at the transcriptional level. Normal Sprague-Dawley rat growth plate chondrocytes from the proliferative zone (PZ) and hypertrophic zone (HZ) were isolated by laser capture microdissection and then subjected to microarray analysis. Confirmation of the differential expression of selected genes was done by in situ hybridization and quantitative reverse transcription (RT) polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A total of 40 transcripts showed at least twofold fgreater expression in the PZ compared to HZ at both 6 and 7 weeks of age, while 52 transcripts showed twofold greater expression in the HZ compared to PZ at these time points. Many of the differentially expressed genes in each zone had very high levels of expression and thus were classified as "enriched transcripts" for that zone. The PZ-enriched transcripts included fibromodulin, proline arginine-rich end leucine-rich repeat protein, lactate dehydrogenase, and enolase 1 alpha. In contrast, HZ-enriched transcripts included collagen I, protein kinase (lysine deficient 4), proteasome (prosome, macropain) activator subunit 4, prostaglandin I2 synthase, and integrin-binding sialoprotein, matrix metalloproteinase 13 (MMP13), and collagen X. Other genes were highly expressed in cells from both zones, including collagen II, aggrecan, cartilage oligomeric protein, cartilage link protein, laminin receptor, and eukaryotic translocation elongation factor. Functional classification of the PZ-enriched transcripts showed an increased percentage of genes expressed in nuclear cell cycle and transcription functions. In contrast, the HZ-enriched transcripts were more involved in extracellular structure and membrane receptor and transporter functions. Pathway analysis indicated that transforming growth factor β and parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) pathways were important in both zones, and bone morphogenic protein pathway played a role in the HZ. It is likely that these differentially expressed genes are involved in regulation of the transition from proliferation to differentiation functions in the growth plate. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

TMS_CUT works like TMS_SPLIT, but it can cut sequences with any combination of TMSs. The BASS program similarly allows comparison of protein repeat elements, equivalent to TMS_SPLIT plus IC, but it provides the comparison data expressed in BLAST E values.

abstract={Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) holoenzymes consist of a catalytic C subunit, a scaffolding A subunit, and one of several regulatory B subunits that recruit the AC dimer to substrates [1, 2]. PP2A is required for chromosome segregation [3-6], but PP2A's substrates in this process remain unknown. To identify PP2A substrates, we carried out a two-hybrid screen with the regulatory B/PR55 subunit. We isolated a human homolog of C. elegans HCP6, a protein distantly related to the condensin subunit hCAP-D2, and we named this homolog hHCP-6. Both C. elegans HCP-6 and condensin are required for chromosome organization and segregation [7-11]. HCP-6 binding partners are unknown, whereas condensin is composed of the structural maintenance of chromosomes proteins SMC2 and SMC4 and of three non-SMC subunits [12]. Here we show that hHCP-6 becomes phosphorylated during mitosis and that its dephosphorylation by PP2A in vitro depends on B/PR55, suggesting that hHCP-6 is a B/PR55-specific substrate of PP2A. Unlike condensin, hHCP-6 is localized in the nucleus in interphase, but similar to condensin, hHCP-6 associates with chromosomes during mitosis. hHCP-6 is part of a complex that contains SMC2, SMC4, kleisin-β, and the previously uncharacterized HEAT repeat protein FLJ20311. hHCP-6 is therefore part of a condensin-related complex that associates with chromosomes in mitosis and may be regulated by PP2A.},

abstract={The origin and evolution of the thousands of species-specific genes with unknown functions, the so-called orphan genes, has been a mystery. Here, we have studied the rates and patterns of orphan sequence evolution, using the Rickettsia as our reference system. Of the Rickettsia conorii orphans examined in this study, 80% were found to be short gene fragments or fusions of short segments from neighboring genes. We reconstructed the putative sequences of the full-length genes from which the short orphan fragments are thought to have originated. One of the genes thus reconstructed displays weak similarity to the ankyrin-repeat protein family, an identification that is strongly supported by comparative molecular modeling. Studies of the patterns of gene fragmentation underscore the importance of short repeated sequences as targets for recombination events that result in sequence loss and the formation of short, transient open reading frames. Our analysis demonstrates that gene sequences present in the common ancestor can be inferred even in cases when no full-length open reading frame is present in any of the contemporary species. Such reconstructions support the identification of lost protein functions and hint at important lifestyle changes. © Society for Molecular Biology and Evolution 2003; all rights reserved.},

abstract={Background: The kelch motif is an ancient and evolutionarily-widespread sequence motif of 44-56 amino acids in length. It occurs as five to seven repeats that form a β-propeller tertiary structure. Over 28 kelch-repeat proteins have been sequenced and functionally characterised from diverse organisms spanning from viruses, plants and fungi to mammals and it is evident from expressed sequence tag, domain and genome databases that many additional hypothetical proteins contain kelch-repeats. In general, kelch-repeat β -propellers are involved in protein-protein interactions, however the modest sequence identity between kelch motifs, the diversity of domain architectures, and the partial information on this protein family in any single species, all present difficulties to developing a coherent view of the kelch-repeat domain and the kelch-repeat protein superfamily. To understand the complexity of this superfamily of proteins, we have analysed by bioinformatics the complement of kelch-repeat proteins encoded in the human genome and have made comparisons to the kelch-repeat proteins encoded in other sequenced genomes. Results: We identified 71 kelch-repeat proteins encoded in the human genome, whereas 5 or 8 members were identified in yeasts and around 18 in C. elegans, D. melanogaster and A. gambiae. Multiple domain architectures were identified in each organism, including previously unrecognised forms. The vast majority of kelch-repeat domains are predicted to form six-bladed β-propellers. The most prevalent domain architecture in the metazoan animal genomes studied was the BTB/ kelch domain organisation and we uncovered 3 subgroups of human BTB/kelch proteins. Sequence analysis of the kelch-repeat domains of the most robustly-related subgroups identified differences in β-propeller organisation that could provide direction for experimental study of protein-binding characteristics. Conclusion: The kelch-repeat superfamily constitutes a distinct and evolutionarily-widespread family of β-propeller domain-containing proteins. Expansion of the family during the evolution of multicellular animals is mainly accounted for by a major expansion of the BTB/kelch domain architecture. BTB/kelch proteins constitute 72 % of the kelch-repeat superfamily of H. sapiens and form three subgroups, one of which appears the most-conserved during evolution. Distinctions in propeller blade organisation between subgroups 1 and 2 were identified that could provide new direction for biochemical and functional studies of novel kelch-repeat proteins. © 2003 Prag and Adams; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={Synaptic plasticity is important for formation of long-term memories and in re-establishment of function following injury. Seven cDNAs enriched following lesion in the hippocampus of the rat have been isolated using a PCR-based cDNA suppression subtraction hybridization. Sequence analysis resulted in the identification of two genes with known roles in synaptic development and neuronal activities: astrotactin and calcineurin. These two neuron-specific genes have established roles in development or synaptogenesis. Sequence analysis of the other five additional genes shows that two are likely to be involved in G-protein signaling pathways, one is a WD repeat protein, and the remaining two are entirely novel. All seven candidates are expressed in the hippocampus and, in some cases, cortical layers of adult brains. RT-PCR data show that expression increases following synaptogenic lesion. Immunocytochemical analysis in primary hippocampal neurons showed that Calcineurin immunoreactivity was redistributed in neurons during 2 weeks in culture. This redistribution suggests that Calcineurin's role changes during neurite outgrowth immediately prior to synapse formation in vitro. In addition, inhibiting Calcineurin activity with cyclosporin A enhanced neurite outgrowth, suggesting that Calcineurin has a regulatory role in axon sprouting. The discovery of previously unknown genes involved in the response to neurodegeneration will contribute to our understanding of neural development, responses to CNS trauma, and neurodegenerative diseases. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={The timely destruction of key regulators through ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis ensures the orderly progression of the cell cycle. The APC (anaphase-promoting complex) is a major component of this degradation machinery and its activation is required for the execution of critical events. Recent studies have just begun to reveal the complex control of the APC through a regulatory network involving WD40 repeat proteins CDC20 and CDH1. In the present paper, we report on the identification and characterization of human CDH1β, a novel alternatively spliced isoform of CDH1. Both CDH1α and CDH1β can bind to the APC and stimulate the degradation of cyclin B1, but they are differentially expressed in human tissues and cells. CDH1α contains a nuclear localization signal which is absent in CDH1β. Intracellularly, CDH1α appears in the nucleus whereas CDH1β is a predominantly cytoplasmic protein. The forced overexpression of CDH1α in cultured cells correlates with the reduction of nuclear cyclin A, but the steady-state amount of cyclin A does not change noticeably in CDH1β-overexpressed cells. In Xenopus embryos, ectopic overexpression of human CDH1α, but not of CDH1β, induces cell-cycle arrest during the first G1 phase at the midblastula transition. Taken together, our findings document the differential expression, subcellular localization and cell-cycle-regulatory activity of human CDH1 isoforms.},

abstract={Ogura cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) in radish (Raphanus sativus) is caused by an aberrant mitochondrial gene, Orf138, that prevents the production of functional pollen without affecting female fertility. Rfo, a nuclear gene that restores male fertility, alters the expression of Orf138 at the post-transcriptional level. The Ogura CMS/Rfo two-component system is a useful model for investigating nuclear-cytoplasmic interactions, as well as the physiological basis of fertility restoration. Using a combination of positional cloning and microsynteny analysis of Arabidopsis thaliana and radish, we genetically and physically delimited the Rfo locus to a 15-kb DNA segment. Analysis of this segment shows that Rfo is a member of the pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) family. In Arabidopsis, this family contains more than 450 members of unknown function, although most of them are predicted to be targeted to mitochondria and chloroplasts and are thought to have roles in organellar gene expression.},

abstract={Purified rice (Oryza sativa) mitochondrial proteins have been arrayed by isoelectric focusing/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), by blue-native (BN) PAGE, and by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (LC) separation (LC-mass spectrometry [MS]). From these protein arrays, we have identified a range of rice mitochondrial proteins, including hydrophilic/hydrophobic proteins (grand average of hydropathicity = -1.27 to +0.84), highly basic and acid proteins (isoelectric point = 4.0-12.5), and proteins over a large molecular mass range (6.7-252 kD), using proteomic approaches. BN PAGE provided a detailed picture of electron transport chain protein complexes. A total of 232 protein spots from isoelectric focusing/PAGE and BN PAGE separations were excised, trypsin digested, and analyzed by tandem MS (MS/MS). Using this dataset, 149 of the protein spots (the products of 91 nonredundant genes) were identified by searching translated rice open reading frames from genomic sequence and six-frame translated rice expressed sequence tags. Sequence comparison allowed us to assign functions to a subset of 85 proteins, including many of the major function categories expected for this organelle. A further six spots were matched to rice sequences for which no specific function has yet been determined. Complete digestion of mitochondrial proteins with trypsin yielded a peptide mixture that was analyzed directly by reverse-phase LC via organic solvent elution from a C-18 column (LC-MS). These data yielded 170 MS/MS spectra that matched 72 sequence entries from open reading frame and expressed sequence tag databases. Forty-five of these were obtained using LC-MS alone, whereas 28 proteins were identified by both LC-MS and gel-based separations. In total, 136 nonredundant rice proteins were identified, including a new set of 23 proteins of unknown function located in plant mitochondria. We also report the first direct identification, to our knowledge, of PPR (pentatricopeptide repeat) proteins in the plant mitochondrial proteome. This dataset provides the first extensive picture, to our knowledge, of mitochondrial functions in a model monocot plant.},

abstract={The identification of antigens mediating tumor rejection is an important goal of cancer immunology. The SEREX technology utilizes antibodies from cancer patients to identify candidate antigens from tumor-derived cDNA expression libraries. Using sera from a long-term surviving metastatic melanoma patient vaccinated with irradiated, autologous tumor cells engineered to secrete granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), we identified an antigen reported to be a putative opioid growth factor receptor (OGFr). The human immune response to OGFr exhibits three features shared with other tumor antigens. First, the protein is an intracellular antigen found in both nucleus and cytoplasm. Second, part of the antibody response is directed at a putative protein product encoded by an alternative reading frame (ARF). Third, part of the antibody response is directed at a portion of the molecule that bears a striking resemblance to the extracellular domain of MUC1, both with respect to primary structure and size polymorphism. Antibody responses to OGFr and a synthetic peptide representing a putative alternative reading frame product (OGFr-ARF) were frequently found in cancer patients. 11/45 (24%) melanoma patients had antibodies to OGFr and 5/45 (11%) had antibodies to OGFr-ARF. Moreover, 5/24 (21%) lung cancer, 4/25 (16%) prostate cancer, and 5/6 breast or ovarian cancer patients had antibodies to OGFr, the alternative frame product, or both. These data add to the growing list of tumor antigens that appear to be translated in two frames, and suggest that OGFr and OGFr-ARF may be useful targets for vaccination.},

abstract={Energy metabolism is the most fundamental capacity for mammals, impairment of which causes a variety of diseases such as type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance. Here, we identified a novel gene, termed diabetes-related ankyrin repeat protein (DARP) that is up-regulated in the heart of KKAy mouse, a type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance model animal. DARP contains putative nuclear localization signals and four tandem ankyrin-like repeats. Its expression is restricted in heart, skeletal muscle, and brown adipose. Western blot analysis and immunocytochemistry of DARP-transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) and COS-7 cells reveal that DARP is a nuclear protein. When DARP is expressed in CHO cells, [1-14C]palmitate uptake is significantly decreased, whereas the palmitate oxidation does not show significant change. Furthermore, DARP expression is altered by the change of energy supply induced by excess fatty acid treatment of skeletal myotube in vitro and fasting treatment of C57 mouse in vivo. We confirmed that DARP expression is also altered in Zucker fatty rat, another insulin resistance model animal. Taken together, these data suggest that DARP is a novel nuclear protein potentially involved in the energy metabolism. Detailed analysis of DARP may provide new insights in the energy metabolism.},

abstract={Axonemes are highly organized microtubule-based structures conserved in many eukaryotes. In an attempt to study axonemes by a proteomics approach, we selectively cloned cDNAs of axonemal proteins by immunoscreening the testis cDNA library from the ascidian Ciona intestinalis by using an antiserum against whole axonemes. We report here a 37-kDa protein of which cDNA occurred most frequently among total positive clones. This protein, named LRR37, belongs to the class of SDS22+ leucine-rich repeat (LRR) family. LRR37 is different from the LRR outer arm dynein light chain reported in Chlamydomonas and sea urchin flagella, and thus represents a novel axonemal LRR protein. Immunoelectron microscopy by using a polyclonal antibody against LRR37 showed that it is localized on the tip of the radial spoke, most likely on the spoke head. The LRR37 protein in fact seems to form a complex together with radial spoke protein 3 in a KI extract of the axonemes. These results suggest that LRR37 is a component of the radial spoke head and is involved in the interaction with other radial spoke components or proteins in the central pair projection.},

abstract={The light chain 1 (LC1) polypeptide is a member of the leucine-rich repeat protein family and binds at or near the ATP hydrolytic site within the motor domain of the γ heavy chain from Chlamydomonas outer arm dynein. It consists of an N-terminal helix, a central barrel formed from six leucine-rich repeats that fold ββα units, and a C-terminal helical domain that protrudes from the main axis defined by the leucine-rich repeats. Interaction with the γ heavy chain is likely mediated through a hydrophobic patch on the larger β sheet face, and the C-terminal region is predicted to insert into the dynein ATP hydrolytic site. Here we have used 1H-15N heteronuclear relaxation measurements obtained at 500 and 600 MHz to refine and validate the LC1 solution structure. In this refined structure, the C-terminal helix is significantly reoriented by more than 20° as compared to the control and provides a more precise understanding of the potential regulatory role of this domain. We also employed the refined structure to perform a dynamic analysis of LC1 using the 600 MHz data set. These results, which were cross validated using the 500 MHz data set, strongly support identification of the predicted LC1 binding surfaces and provide additional insight into the interaction mechanisms of leucine-rich repeat proteins.},

abstract={Recent studies in humans have highlighted the importance of a distinct cellular entity, the plasmacytoid dendritic cell (PDC). To identify genes for which expression is restricted to human PDCs, a cDNA subtraction technique was applied using cDNA from activated monocyte-derived DCs (MDDCs) as competitor. In the 650 sequences analyzed, 25% were for B-cell transcripts. We also found lymphoid-related genes, immunoglobulinlike transcript 7 (ILT7), granzyme B (GrB), Spi-B, and the receptor tyrosine kinase Eph-Bl. Granzyme B was up-regulated on activation, and protein was detected only in PDCs. Eph-B1 protein was expressed in the cytoplasm and the nuclei of PDCs and MDDCs, respectively. Interestingly, several novel molecules have been identified that were predicted to encode for a type 2 transmembrane protein (BRI3), a putative cytokine (C-15, a cysteine-rich-secreted protein), and a type 1 leucine-rich repeat protein (MAPA). The identification of genes expressed in PDCs provides new insights into their function and origin. © 2002 by The American Society of Hematology.},

abstract={Muskelin was identified in vertebrates as a novel, intracellular, kelch repeat protein that is needed in cell-spreading responses to the matrix adhesion molecule, thrombospondin-1. The identification and characterization of an orthologue of muskelin in Drosophila melanogaster is now reported. The Drosophila muskelin gene, located on chromosome 2R, is encoded in ten exons. Drosophila muskelin is expressed in embryos, larvae and adult flies. The protein has 45% sequence identity to vertebrate muskelins, with highest sequence identity in an amino-terminal domain and the six kelch repeats that form a β-propeller structure. Multiple sequence alignment of human, mouse, rat and Drosophila muskelins and protein database searches revealed a novel highly conserved motif within the amino-terminal domain, lissencephaly homology motif (LisH) and C-terminal to LisH motifs in the central region of the molecule, and several conserved consensus motifs for phosphorylation by protein kinase C and casein kinase II. These findings provide new information on the modular structure of muskelin and indicate potential for conserved mechanisms of function. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={A simple sequence is abundant in the proteins that have been sequenced to date. But unusual protein features, such as a simple sequence, are not present in the same high frequency within structural databases. A subset of these simple sequences, a group with a highly repetitive nature has been shown to be abundant in eukaryotes but not in prokaryotes. In this study, an examination of the eukaryotic proteins in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) has revealed a large deficiency of low complexity, highly repetitive protein repeats. Through simulated databases of similar samples of eukaryotic proteins taken from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database, it is shown that the PDB contains a significantly less highly repetitive, simple sequence than artificial databases of similar composition randomly derived from NCBI. When the structural data for those few PDB sequences that did contain a highly repetitive simple sequence is examined in detail, it is found that in most cases the tertiary structure is unknown for the regions consisting of a simple sequence. This lack of a simple sequence both in the PDB database and in the structural information suggests that this type of simple sequence may produce disordered structures that make structural characterization difficult. © 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract={With the aim of identifying new intracellular binding partners for acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF), proteins from U2OS human osteosarcoma cells were adsorbed to immobilized aFGF. One of the adsorbed proteins is a member of the leucine-rich repeat protein family termed ribosome-binding protein p34 (p34). This protein has previously been localized to endoplasmic reticulum membranes and is thought to span the membrane with the N terminus on the cytosolic side. Confocal microscopy of cells transfected with Myc-p34 confirmed the endoplasmic reticulum localization, and Northern blotting determined p34 mRNA to be present in a multitude of different tissues. Cross-linking experiments indicated that the protein is present in the cell as a dimer. In vitro translated p34 was found to interact with maltose-binding protein-aFGF through its cytosolic coiled-coil domain. The interaction between aFGF and p34 was further characterized by surface plasmon resonance, giving a KD of 1.4 ± 0.3 μM. Even though p34 interacted with mitogenic aFGF, it bound poorly to the non-mitogenic aFGF(K132E) mutant, indicating a possible involvement of p34 in intracellular signaling by aFGF.},

abstract={In Arabidopsis, RPP4 confers resistance to Peronospora parasitica (P.p.) races Emoy2 and Emwa1 (downy mildew). We identified RPP4 in Col-0 as a member of the clustered RPP5 multigene family encoding nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat proteins with Toll/interleukin-1 receptor domains. RPP4 is the orthologue of RPP5 which, in addition to recognizing P.p. race Noco2, also mediates resistance to Emoy2 and Emwa1. Most differences between RPP4 and RPP5 occur in residues that constitute the TIR domain and in LRR residues that are predicted to confer recognition specificity. RPP4 requires the action of at least 12 defence components, including DTH9, EDS1, PAD4, PAL, PBS2, PBS3, SID1, SID2 and salicylic acid. The ndr1, npr1 and rps5-1 mutations partially compromise RPP4 function in cotyledons but not in true leaves. The identification of RPP4 as a TIR-NB-LRR protein, coupled with its dependence on certain signalling components in true leaves, is consistent with the hypothesis that distinct NB-LRR protein classes differentially signal through EDS1 and NDR1. Our results suggest that RPP4-mediated resistance is developmentally regulated and that in cotyledons there is cross-talk between EDS1 and NDR1 signalling and processes regulating systemic acquired resistance.},

abstract={The survival of motor neurons (SMN) protein is the product of the disease gene of spinal muscular atrophy and is found both in the cytoplasm and the nucleus, where it is concentrated in gems. SMN is part of a multiprotein complex that includes Gemin2, Gemin3, and Gemin4. The SMN complex plays an important role in the cytoplasmic assembly of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) and likely other RNPs in pre-mRNA splicing and in the assembly of transcriptosomes. Here, we report the identification of an additional component of the SMN complex, a novel WD repeat protein termed Gemin5. Gemin5 binds SMN directly and is a component of the SMN complex. Furthermore, Gemin5 interacts with several of the snRNP core proteins including SmB, SmD1, SmD2, SmD3, and SmE, suggesting that it participates in the activities of the SMN complex in snRNP assembly. Immunolocalization studies demonstrate that Gemin5 is found in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus, where it colocalizes with SMN in gems. The presence of 13 WD repeat domains in the amino-terminal half of Gemin5 and a coiled-coil motif near its carboxyl terminus indicate that it may form a large heteromeric complex and engage in multiple interactions.},

abstract={Three-dimensional structures have been determined of a large number of proteins characterized by a repetitive fold where each of the repeats (coils) supplies a strand to one or more parallel β-sheets. Some of these proteins form superfamilies of proteins, which have probably arisen by divergent evolution from a common ancestor. The classical example is the family including four families of pectinases without obviously related primary sequences, the phage P22 tailspike endorhamnosidase, chrondroitinase B and possibly pertactin from Bordetella pertusis. These show extensive stacking of similar residues to give aliphatic, aromatic and polar stacks such as the asparagine ladder. This suggests that coils can be added or removed by duplication or deletion of the DNA corresponding to one or more coils and explains how homologous proteins can have different numbers of coils. This process can also account for the evolution of other families of proteins such as the β-rolls, the leucine-rich repeat proteins, the hexapeptide repeat family, two separate families of β-helical antifreeze proteins and the spiral folds. These families need not be related to each other but will share features such as relative untwisted β-sheets, stacking of similar residues and turns between β-strands of approximately 90°often stabilized by hydrogen bonding along the direction of the parallel β-helix. Repetitive folds present special problems in the comparison of structures but offer attractive targets for structure prediction. The stacking of similar residues on a flat parallel β-sheet may account for the formation of amyloid with β-strands at right-angles to the fibril axis from many unrelated peptides. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract={The discovery of molecules required for membrane fusion has revealed a remarkably conserved mechanism that centers upon the formation of a complex of SNARE proteins. However, whether the SNARE proteins or other components catalyze the final steps of membrane fusion in vivo remains unclear. Understanding this last step depends on the identification of molecules that act late in the fusion process. Here we demonstrate that in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Vac8p, a myristoylated and palmitoylated armadillo repeat protein, is required for homotypic vacuole fusion. Vac8p is palmitoylated during the fusion reaction, and the ability of Vac8p to be palmitoylated appears to be necessary for its function in fusion. Both in vivo and in vitro analyses show that Vac8p functions after both Rab-dependent vacuole docking and the formation of trans-SNARE pairs. We propose that Vac8p may bind the fusion machinery through its armadillo repeats and that palmitoylation brings this machinery to a specialized lipid domain that facilitates bilayer mixing.},

abstract={The heterodimeric Elongin BC complex has been shown to interact in vitro and in mammalian cells with a conserved BC-box motif found in a growing number of proteins including RNA polymerase II elongation factor Elongin A, SOCS-box proteins, and the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor protein. Recently, the VHL-Elongin BC complex was found to interact with a module composed of Cullin family member Cul2 and RING-H2 finger protein Rbxl to reconstitute a novel E3 ubiquitin ligase that activates ubiquitylation by the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes Ubc5 and Cdc34. In the context of the VHL ubiquitin ligase, Elongin BC functions as an adaptor that links the VHL protein to the Cul2/Rbx1 module, raising the possibility that the Elongin BC complex could function as an integral component of a larger family of E3 ubiquitin ligases by linking alternative BC-box proteins to Cullin/Rbx1 modules. In this report, we describe identification and purification from rat liver of a novel leucine-rich repeat-containing BC-box protein, MUF1, which we demonstrate is capable of assembling with a Cullin/Rbxl module containing the Cullin family member Cul5 to reconstitute ubiquitin ligase activity. In addition, we show that the additional BC-box proteins Elongin A, SOCS1, and WSB1 are also capable of assembling with the Cul5/Rbxl module to reconstitute potential ubiquitin ligases. Taken together, our findings identify MUF1 as a new member of the BC-box family of proteins, and they predict the existence of a larger family of Elongin BC-based E3 ubiquitin ligases.},

abstract={Host cell factor 1 (HCF-1) is a cellular transcriptional coactivator which coordinates the assembly of enhancer complex through direct interactions with viral and cellular trans-activators such as VP16, Oct-1, LZIP, and GA-binding protein. These interactions are mediated by the β-propeller domain comprising the first 380 residues of HCF-1 with six kelch repeats. Here we describe the identification and characterization of a novel HCF-like kelch repeat protein, designated HCLP-1. HCLP-1 is a ubiquitously expressed nuclear protein which is composed almost entirely of a six-bladed β-propeller. HCLP-1 selectively interacts with LZIP but not with VP16. The physical interaction between HCLP-1 and LZIP leads to the repression of the LZIP-dependent transcription. The HCLP-1-binding domain of LZIP maps to residues 109-315, which contain the bZIP DNA-binding motif. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay demonstrates that HCLP-1 indeed interferes with the binding of LZIP to its DNA target. Thus, HCLP-1 serves a transcriptional co-repressor function mediated through its inhibitory interaction with the LZIP transcription factor. Our findings suggest a new mechanism for transcriptional regulation by HCF-like proteins.},

abstract={A strategy of mutagenesis followed by yeast two-hybrid assay was used to determine the sites on the WD-repeat protein Receptor for Activated C Kinase 1 (RACK1) necessary for it to interact with the cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase isoform PDE4D5. Analysis of deletion mutations demonstrated that WD-repeats 5-7, inclusively, of RACK1 contained the major site for interaction with PDE4D5. A reverse two-hybrid screen focusing on WD-repeats 5-7 of RACK1 isolated 11 single amino acid mutations from within this region that blocked the interaction. The ability of these mutations to block the interaction was confirmed by "pull-down" assays using bacterially expressed glutathione-S-transferase (GST)-RACK1 and mammalian cell-expressed PDE4D5. A model of RACK1 structure, based on the structural similarity of RACK1 to other β-propeller WD-repeat proteins, indicated that the majority of the amino acids identified by mutagenesis are clustered in a discrete surface of RACK1. We propose that this surface of RACK1 is the major site for its interaction with the unique amino-terminal region of PDE4D5. © 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.},

abstract={ARM and HEAT motifs are tandemly repeated sequences of approximately 50 amino acid residues that occur in a wide variety of eukaryotic proteins. An exhaustive search of sequence databases detected new family members and revealed that at least 1 in 500 eukaryotic protein sequences contain such repeats. It also rendered the similarity between ARM and HEAT repeats, believed to be evolutionarily related, readily apparent. All the proteins identified in the database searches could be clustered by sequence similarity into four groups: canonical ARM-repeat proteins and three groups of the more divergent HEAT-repeat proteins. This allowed us to build improved sequence profiles for the automatic detection of repeat motifs. Inspection of these profiles indicated that the individual repeat motifs of all four classes share a common set of seven highly conserved hydrophobic residues, which in proteins of known three-dimensional structure are buried within or between repeats. However, the motifs differ at several specific residue positions, suggesting important structural or functional differences among the classes. Our results illustrate that ARM and HEAT-repeat proteins, while having a common phylogenetic origin, have since diverged significantly. We discuss evolutionary scenarios that could account for the great diversity of repeats observed. © 2001 Academic Press.},

abstract={Asporin, a novel member of the leucine-rich repeat family of proteins, was partially purified from human articular cartilage and meniscus. Cloning of human and mouse asporin cDNAs revealed that the protein is closely related to decorin and biglycan. It contains a putative propeptide, 4 amino-terminal cysteines, 10 leucine-rich repeats, and 2 C-terminal cysteines. In contrast to decorin and biglycan, asporin is not a proteoglycan. Instead, asporin contains a unique stretch of aspartic acid residues in its amino-terminal region. A polymorphism was identified in that the number of consecutive aspartate residues varied from 11 to 15. The 8 exons of the human asporin gene span 26 kilobases on chromosome 9q31.1-32, and the putative promoter region lacks TATA consensus. sequences. The asporin mRNA is expressed in a variety of human tissues with higher levels in osteoarthritic articular cartilage, aorta, uterus, heart, and liver. The deduced amino acid sequence of asporin was confirmed by mass spectrometry of the isolated protein resulting in 84% sequence coverage. The protein contains an N-glycosylation site at Asn281 with a heterogeneous oligosaccharide structure and a potential O-glycosylation site at Ser54. The name asporin reflects the aspartate-rich amino terminus and the overall similarity to decorin.},

abstract={Synechocystis PCC6803 possesses several open reading frames encoding putative WD-repeat proteins. One, the Hat protein, is involved in the control of a high-affinity transport system for inorganic carbon that is active when the cells are grown under a limiting concentration of this carbon substrate. The protein is composed of two major domains separated by a hydrophobic linker region of 20 amino acid residues. The N-terminal domain of Hat has no homolog in standard databases and does not display any particular structural features. Eleven WD repeats have been identified in the C-terminal moiety. The region encompassing the four terminal WD repeats is essential for growth under a limiting inorganic carbon regime. The region encompassing the two most terminal WD repeats is required for the activity of the high-affinity transport system. However, because the Hat protein is located in the thylakoids, it should not be itself an element of the transport system. The structural organization of the WD-containing domain of Hat was modeled from the crystal structure of the G protein β subunit (with seven WD repeats) and of hemopexin (a structural analog with four blades). Functional and structural data argue in favor of an organization of the Hat WD moiety in two subdomains of seven and four WD repeats. The C-terminal 4-mer subdomain might interact with another, yet unknown, protein/peptide. This interaction could be essential in modulating the stability of the 4-mer structure and, thus, the accessibility of this subdomain, or at least of the region encompassing the last two WD repeats.},

abstract={A detailed analysis of the secondary structure has been carried out on the polygalacturonase-inhibiting protein (PGIP) from Phaseolus vulgaris, a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) protein present in the cell wall of many plants. Far-UV CD and infrared spectroscopies coupled to constrained secondary structure prediction methods indicated the presence of 12 α- and 12 β-segments, thus allowing a schematic representation of three domains of the protein, namely, the central LRR region and the two cysteine-rich flanking domains. Peptides from endoproteinase-degraded PGIP were analyzed by mass spectrometry, and four disulfide bonds were identified. Mass spectrometric analysis in combination with glycosidase treatments revealed two N-linked oligosaccharides located on Asn 64 and Asn 141. The main structure resembled the typical complex plant N-glycan consisting of a core pentasaccharide β1,2-xylosylated, carrying an α1,3-fucose linked to the innermost N-acetylglucosamine and one outer arm N-acetylglucosamine residue. The schematic representation of PGIP structural domains is discussed in the framework of the structure and function of LRR proteins.},

Arpp protein is composed of 333 amino acids and contains four ankyrin-like repeat motifs in the middle portion of the protein, a PEST-like sequence and a lysine-rich sequence similar to a nuclear localization signal in the N-terminal region, and a proline-rich region containing consensus phosphorylation sites in the C-terminal region. Protein sequence analysis revealed that Arpp is homologous (52.7% identity) to Carp which is shown to be involved in the regulation of the transcription of the cardiac ventricular myosin light chain 2 gene. Arpp mRNA was found to be expressed in normal skeletal and cardiac muscle. Interestingly, Arpp expression was detectable in bilateral ventricles, but undetectable in bilateral atria and large vessels, suggesting that Arpp may play a specific function in cardiac ventricles as well as skeletal muscles. © 2001 Academic Press.},

abstract={Nucleotide excision repair is a highly versatile DNA repair system responsible for elimination of a wide variety of lesions from the genome. It is comprised of two subpathways: transcription-coupled repair that accomplishes efficient removal of damage blocking transcription and global genome repair. Recently, the basic mechanism of global genome repair has emerged from biochemical studies. However, little is known about transcription-coupled repair in eukaryotes. Here we report the identification of a novel protein designated XAB2 (XPA-binding protein 2) that was identified by virtue of its ability to interact with XPA, a factor central to both nucleotide excision repair subpathways. The XAB2 protein of 855 amino acids consists mainly of 15 tetratricopeptide repeats. In addition to interacting with XPA, immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrafed that a fraction of XAB2 is able to interact with the transcription-coupled repair-specific proteins CSA and CSB as well as RNA polymerase II. Furthermore, antibodies against XAB2 inhibited both transcription-coupled repair and transcription in vivo but not global genome repair when microinjected into living fibroblasts. These results indicate that XAB2 is a novel component involved in transcription-coupled repair and transcription.},

abstract={Determination of the structures of fibroblast growth factors and interleukin-1s has previously revealed that they both adopt a β-trefoil fold, similar to those found in Kunitz soybean trypsin inhibitors, ricin-like toxins, plant agglutinins and hisactophilin. These families possess distinct functions and occur in different subcellular localisations, and they appear to lack significant similarities in their sequences, ligands and modes of ligand binding. We have analysed the significance of sequence identities observed after structure alignment and provide statistical evidence that these β-trefoil proteins are all homologues, having arisen from a common ancestor. In addition, we have explored the sequence space of all β-trefoil proteins and have determined that the actin-binding proteins fascins, and other proteins of unknown function, are β-trefoil family homologues. Unlike other β-trefoil proteins, the triplicated repeats in each of the four β-trefoil domains of fascins are significantly similar in sequence. This hints at how the β-trefoil fold arose from the duplication of an ancestral gene encoding a homotrimeric single-repeat protein. The combined analysis of structure and sequence databases for detecting significant similarities is suggested as a highly sensitive approach to determining the common ancestry of extremely divergent homologues.

abstract={The ankyrin repeat is an abundant, 33 residue sequence motif that forms a consecutive β-hairpin-helix-loop-helix (β2α2) fold. Most ankyrin repeat proteins consist of four or more complete repeats, which provide stabilizing interactions between adjacent modules. The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor and tumor suppressor p16(INK4) (p16) is one of the smallest ankyrin repeat proteins with a known structure. It consists of four complete repeats plus short N and C-terminal flanking regions that are unstructured in solution. On the basis of preliminary proteolysis studies and predictions using a computer algorithm for identifying autonomous folding units, we have identified a fragment consisting of the third and fourth ankyrin repeats of p16, called p16C, that can fold independently, without the rest of the protein. Far-UV circular dichroism studies showed that p16C has a significant level of α-helical secondary structure, and two proline substitutions that disrupt the α-helical secondary structure in wild-type p16 disrupt the secondary structure in p16C. The thermal denaturation of p16C is cooperative and reversible, with a midpoint of transition at 30.5 (±1) °C. From ureainduced denaturation studies, the free energy of unfolding for p16C was estimated to be 1.7(±0.3) kcal/mol at 20 °C. 1H-15N 2D NMR studies suggest that the ankyrin repeats in p16C are likely to fold into a structure. similar to that of full-length p16. In order to define the minimum autonomous folding unit in p16, we have further dissected p16C into two complementary peptides, each containing a single ankyrin repeat. These peptides are unstructured in solution. Thus, p16C is the smallest ankyrin repeat module that is known to fold independently and, in general, we believe that the two-ankyrin repeat fold could be the minimum structural unit for all ankyrin repeat proteins. We further discuss the significance of p16C in protein folding and engineering. (C) 2000 Academic Press.},

abstract={Mechanically induced hypertrophy of skeletal muscles involves shifts in gene expression leading to increases in the synthesis of specific proteins. Full characterization of the regulation of muscle hypertrophy is a prerequisite for the development of novel therapies aimed at treating muscle wasting (atrophy) in human aging and disease. Using suppression subtractive hybridization, cDNAs corresponding to mRNAs that increase in relative abundance in response to mechanical stretch of mouse skeletal muscles in vivo were identified. A novel 1100- bp transcript was detected exclusively in skeletal muscle. This exhibited a fourfold increase in expression after 7 days of stretch. The transcript had an open reading frame of 328 amino acids encoding an ATP/GTP binding domain, a nuclear localization signal, two PEST protein-destabilization motifs, and a 132-amino- acid ankyrin-repeat region. We have named this gene ankyrin- repeat domain 2 (stretch-responsive muscle) (Ankrd2). We hypothesize that Ankrd2 plays an important role in skeletal muscle hypertrophy. (C) 2000 Academic Press.},

abstract={Short protein repeats, frequently with a length between 20 and 40 residues, represent a significant fraction of known proteins. Many repeats appear to possess high amino acid substitution rates and thus recognition of repeat homologues is highly problematic. Even if the presence of a certain repeat family is known, the exact locations and the number of repetitive units often cannot be determined using current methods. We have devised an iterative algorithm based on optimal and sub-optimal score distributions from profile analysis that estimates the significance of all repeats that are detected in a single sequence. This procedure allows the identification of homologues at alignment scores lower than the highest optimal alignment score for non-homologous sequences. The method has been used to investigate the occurrence of eleven families of repeats in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Caenorhabditis elegans and Homo sapiens accounting for 1055, 2205 and 2320 repeats, respectively. For these examples, the method is both more sensitive and more selective than conventional homology search procedures. The method allowed the detection in the SwissProt database of more than 2000 previously unrecognised repeats belonging to the 11 families. In addition, the method was used to merge several repeat families that previously were supposed to be distinct, indicating common phylogenetic origins for these families. (C) 2000 Academic Press.},

abstract={Smad proteins play a key role in the intracellular signaling of the transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) superfamily of extracellular polypeptides that initiate signaling from the cell surface through serine/threonine kinase receptors. A subclass of Smad proteins, including Smad6 and Smad7, has been shown to function as intracellular antagonists of TGF-β family signaling. We have previously reported the identification of a WD40 repeat protein, STRAP, that associates with both type I and type II TGF- β receptors and that is involved in TGF-β signaling. Here we demonstrate that STRAP synergizes specifically with Smad7, but not with Smad6, in the inhibition of TGF-β-induced transcriptional responses. STRAP does not show cooperation with a C-terminal deletion mutant of Smad7 that does not bind with the receptor and consequently has no inhibitory activity. STRAP associates stably with Smad7, but not with the Smad7 mutant. STRAP recruits Smad7 to the activated type I receptor and forms a complex. Moreover, STRAP stabilizes the association between Smad7 and the activated receptor, thus assisting Smad7 in preventing Smad2 and Smad3 access to the receptor. STRAP interacts with Smad2 and Smad3 but does not cooperate functionally with these Smads to transactivate TGF-β-dependent transcription. The C terminus of STRAP is required for its phosphorylation in vivo, which is dependent on the TGF-β receptor kinases. Thus, we describe a mechanism to explain how STRAP and Smad7 function synergistically to block TGF-β-induced transcriptional activation.},

abstract={The zebrafish, Danio rerio, has three types of pigment cells (melanophores, xanthophores and iridophores) and, in adult fish, these cells are organized into a stripe pattern. The mechanisms underlying formation of the stripe pattern are largely unknown. We report here the identification and characterization of a novel dominant zebrafish mutation, hagoromo (hag), which was generated by insertional mutagenesis using a pseudotyped retrovirus. The hag mutation caused disorganized stripe patterns. TWO hag mutant alleles were isolated independently and proviruses were located within the fifth intron of a novel gene, which we named hag, encoding an F-box/WD40-repeat protein. The hag gene was mapped to linkage group (LG)13, close to fgf8 and pax2.1. Amino acid sequence similarity, conserved exon-intron boundaries and conserved synteny indicated that zebrafish hag is an ortholog of mouse Dactylin, the gene mutated in the Dactylaplasia (Dac) mouse. The Dac mutation is dominant and causes defects in digit formation in fore- and hindlimbs. This study revealed that the hag locus is important for pattern formation in fish but is involved in distinct morphogenetic events in different vertebrates.},

abstract={The DmX gene was recently isolated from the X chromosome of Drosophila melanogaster. TBLASTN searches of the dbEST databases revealed sequences with a high level of similarity to DmX in a variety of different species, including insects, nematodes, and mammals showing that DmX is an evolutionarily highly conserved gene. Here we describe the cloning of the cDNA and the chromosomal localization of one of the human homologues of DmX, Dmx-like 1 (DMXL1). The human DMXL1 gene codes for a large mRNA of 11 kb with an open reading frame of 3027 amino acids. The putative protein belongs to the superfamily of WD repeat proteins, which have mostly regulatory functions. The DMXL1 protein contains an exceptionally large number of WD repeat units. The DMXL1 gene is located on chromosome 5q22 as determined by radiation hybrid mapping and fluorescence in situ hybridization. Although the function of the DMXL1 gene and its homologues in other species remains to be discovered, the high level of evolutionary conservation together with the unusual structure suggests that it probably has an important function.

abstract={A prominent 45-kDa component was identified by protein staining following SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of a 4 M guanidine hydrochloride extract from bovine vitreous collagen fibrils. Peptide sequences obtained from this component were used as a basis for the cloning (from human retinal cDNA) and sequencing of a novel member of the leucine- rich repeat extracellular matrix protein family that we have named opticin. Opticin mRNA was found by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction in ligament and skin as well as in retina. An open reading frame containing 332 amino acids was identified, the first 19 amino acids representing a signal peptide. The deduced amino acid sequence of the mature protein encodes a 35- kDa protein with a calculated isoelectric point of 5.4. The central domain of this protein consists of six B-type leucine-rich repeats. This domain is flanked by cysteine clusters including a C-terminal two-cysteine cluster containing an additional leucine-rich repeat. The N-terminal region contains a cluster of potential O-glycosylation sites, and analysis of bovine vitreous opticin demonstrated the presence of sialylated O-linked oligosaccharides substituting the core protein. Opticin shows highest protein sequence identity to epiphycan (42%) and osteoglycin (35%) and belongs to Class III of the leucine-rich repeat extracellular matrix protein family.},

All three mutants grew photoautotrophically but they were affected in psbA2 expression. In one of the mutants, ΔU80, psbA2 transcription levels were not suppressed under low light conditions and production of psbA2 transcripts occurred also in darkness, in contrast to the situation in the control strain. Comparative sequence analyses of the mutants identified a hexanucleotide repeat as possible cis element in psbA2 light regulation. Electrophoresis mobility shift assays showed that protein binding to the hexanucleotide repeat decreased with light intensity, consistent with a hypothesis that the repeat harbors a binding site for a repressor protein. Repeats similar to that in psbA2 were found also in the upstream region of other light-regulated genes in Synechocystsis 6803. We refer to these hexanucleotide repeats as High Light Regulatory 1 (HLR1) sequences. (C) 2000 Academic Press.},

abstract={Suppression subtractive hybridization was used to identify genes regulated by ozone (100 nmol mol-1) in Pisum sativum. One novel gene (named PsUod1) was found. In addition, mRNA levels for four genes (encoding lipid transfer protein, pre-hevein-like protein, leucine-rich repeat protein, and disease-resistance response protein 230), which previously were shown to be regulated by biotic stress, increased. Finally, mRNA species for two genes (encoding extensin and pathogenesis-related protein 4A), previously shown to be regulated by ozone in other species, were found to increase in abundance. The ozone-specificity of the expression of these genes was studied by using UV-B radiation. PsUod1 and the genes encoding extensin, leucine-rich repeat protein, and disease-resistance response protein 230, were differentially regulated when comparing ozone and UV-B. Moreover, the mRNA levels for extensin, leucine-rich repeat protein and disease-resistance response protein 230 all increased under NaCl and aluminium stress and after wounding, whereas the message abundance for PsUod1 was unchanged under these stresses. Thus, in general, ozone caused changes similar to wounding, salt stress and aluminium stress, whereas UV-B radiation regulated gene expression differently.},

abstract={A novel testis-specific protein, termed LRTP, was identified by screening both human and mouse testis and mouse pachytene spermatocyte cDNA libraries. Sequence analyses (GenBank accession number: AF092208) revealed that LRTP contains an amino terminus leucine-rich repeat domain. There are several acidic regions rich in glutamic acid in the C-terminus. The sequence, by GenBank search, shows similarities to LANP and SDS22+, leucine-rich repeat proteins localized to the nucleus and involved in the regulation of protein phosphatases. In mouse, the mRNA is first detected at about Day 14 postpartum, presumably when mid-pachytene spermatocytes are first seen. In situ hybridization confirmed the expression of the LRTP mRNA at this stage of spermatogenesis. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the protein is most abundant in the cytoplasm of pachytene and diplotene cells, corresponding to late prophase of meiosis I. Immunohistochemical localization is markedly reduced in secondary spermatocytes, suggesting a functional association of LRTP with meiosis. An LRTP cDNA probe did not bind to mouse ovary RNA in a dot blot assay.},

abstract={X-linked congenital stationary night blindness (XLCSNB) is characterized by impaired scotopic vision with associated ocular symptoms such as myopia, hyperopia, nystagmus and reduced visual acuity1. Genetic mapping in families with XLCSNB revealed two different loci on the proximal short arm of the X chromosome2. These two genetic subtypes can be distinguished on the basis of electroretinogram (ERG) responses and psychophysical testing as a complete (CSNB1) and an incomplete (CSNB2) form3,4. The CSNB1 locus has been mapped to a 5-cM linkage interval in Xp11.4 (refs 2,5-7). Here we construct and analyse a contig between the markers DXS993 and DXS228, leading to the identification of a new gene mutated in CSNB1 patients. It is partially deleted in 3 families and mutation analysis in a further 21 families detected another 13 different mutations. This gene, designated NYX, encodes a protein of 481 amino acids (nyctalopin) and is expressed at low levels in tissues including retina, brain, testis and muscle. The predicted polypeptide is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored extracellular protein with 11 typical and 2 cysteine-rich, leucine-rich repeats (LRRs). This motif is important for protein-protein interactions and members of the LRR superfamily are involved in cell adhesion and axon guidance(8-10). Future functional analysis of nyctalopin might therefore give insight into the fine-regulation of cell-cell contacts in the retina.},

abstract={The Drosophila gene ten-m is the first pair-rule gene not encoding a transcription factor, but an extracellular protein. We have characterized a highly conserved chicken homologue that we call teneurin-1. The C-terminal part harbors 26 repetitive sequence motifs termed YD-repeats. The YD-repeats are most similar to the core of the rhs elements of Escherichia coli. Related repeats in toxin A of Clostridium difficile are known to bind specific carbohydrates. We show that recombinantly expressed proteins containing the YD-repeats of teneurin-1 bind to heparin. Furthermore, heparin lyase treatment of extracts of cells expressing recombinant YD-repeat protein releases this protein from high molecular mass aggregates. In situ hybridization and immunostaining reveals teneurin-1 expression in neurons of the developing visual system of chicken and Drosophila. This phylogenetic conservation of neuronal expression from flies to birds implies fundamental roles for teneurin-1 in neurogenesis. This is supported by the neurite outgrowth occurring on substrates made of recombinant YD-repeat proteins, which can be inhibited by heparin. Database searches resulted in the identification of ESTs encoding at least three further members of the teneurin family of proteins. Furthermore, the human teneurin-1 gene could be identified on chromosome Xq24/25, a region implied in an X-linked mental retardation syndrome.},

abstract={Signal-induced phosphorylation of IκBα targets this inhibitor of NF- κB for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation, thus allowing NF-κB to enter the nucleus to turn on its target genes. We report here the identification of an IκB-ubiquitin (Ub) ligase complex containing the F- box/WD40-repeat protein, β-TrCP, a vertebrate homolog of Drosophila Slimb. β-TrCP binds to IκBα only when the latter is specifically phosphorylated by an IκB kinase complex. Moreover, immunopurified β-TrCP ubiquitinates phosphorylated IκBα at specific lysines in the presence of Ub-activating (E1) and -conjugating (Ubch5) enzymes. A β-TrCP mutant lacking the F-box inhibits the signal-induced degradation of IκBα and subsequent activation of NF-κB-dependent transcription. Furthermore, Drosophila embryos deficient in slimb fail to activate twist and snail, two genes known to be regulated by the NF-κB homolog, Dorsal. These biochemical and genetic data strongly suggest that Slimb/β-TrCP is the specificity determinant for the signal- induced ubiquitination of IκBα.},

In contrast, an Ets-binding site residing 497 upstream of the transcription site can lead to the repression of gene expression. The analysis of nuclear proteins by gel retardation studies with the repressor element identified a common protein, presumably an Ets family member, present in neonatal chondrocytes and skin fibroblasts that do not express the PRELP gene. The factor was not detected in nuclear protein preperations from adult chondrocytes in which the PRELP gene is expressed.},

abstract={Two functionally distinct but homologous sites in complement receptor type 1 (CR1) (CD35) were further characterized by homologous substitution mutagenesis of two CR1 derivatives, each containing one site. In both sites, reducing negative and/or increasing positive charge augmented interaction with iC3/C3b and C4b, supporting a role of ionic forces in the binding reaction. In one case, substitution of Asp at the end of complement control protein repeat (CCP) 2 with an Asn transformed the protein, with negligible cofactor activity and iC3 binding, into a mutant with activities similar to native CR1. Consequently, this protein, one-fourth the size of CR1, is a therapeutic candidate for a complement inhibitor. Another important observation is that the residues between two CCPs contribute to activity, probably because they influence positioning of one CCP relative to the next. The initial characterization of the third CCP of an active site led to identification of three peptides necessary for binding. In line with earlier findings for the first two CCPs, interactions with iC3/C3b are similar but not identical to those with C4b, implying overlapping but distinct binding domains. Moreover, changes in cofactor activity usually, but not always, parallel alterations in binding, indicating that these two activities are separable. We also mapped epitopes for a blocking and a function enhancing monoclonal antibody. Their effects can be explained by epitope location. The first antibody binds near functionally important residues. The second may shield inhibitory (negatively charged) residues. These results represent a comprehensive analysis of the active sites of CR1, which is built of modules found in more than 50 mammalian proteins.},

abstract={The superfamily of leucine-rich repeat proteins can be subdivided into at least six subfamilies, characterised by different lengths and consensus sequences of the repeats. It was proposed that the repeats from different subfamilies retain a similar superhelical fold, but differ in the three-dimensional structures of individual repeats. The sequence-structure relationship of three new subfamilies was examined by molecular modelling. I provide structural models for the repeats of all subfamilies. The models enable me to explain residue conservations within each subfamily. Furthermore, the difference in the packing explains why the repeats from different subfamilies never occur simultaneously in the same protein. Finally, these studies suggest different evolutionary origins for the different subfamilies. The approach used for the prediction of the leucine-rich repeat protein structures can be applied to other proteins containing internal repeats of about 20 to 30 residue in length.},

abstract={We report here that Hap1p (originally named Cyp1p) has an essential function in anaerobic or heme-deficient growth. Analysis of intragenic revertants shows that this function depends on the amino acid preceding the first cysteine residue of the DNA-binding domain of Hap1p. Selection of recessive extragenic suppressors of a hap1-hem1- strain allowed the identification, cloning, and molecular analysis of ASC1 (Cyp1 Absence of growth Supressor). The sequence of ASC1 reveals that its ORF is interrupted by an intron that shelters the U24 snoRNA. Deletion of the intron, inactivation of the ORF, and molecular localization of the mutations show unambiguously that it is the protein and not the snoRNA that is involved in the suppressor phenotype. ASC1, which is constitutively transcribed, encodes an abundant, cytoplasmically localized 35-kD protein that belongs to the WD repeat family, which is found in a large variety of eucaryotic organisms. Polysome profile analysis supports the involvement of this protein in translation. We propose that the absence of functional Asc1p allows the growth of hap1-hem1- cells by reducing the efficiency of translation. Based on sequence comparisons, we discuss the possibility that the protein intervenes in a kinase-dependent signal transduction pathway involved in this last function.},

abstract={Motivation: Decomposing each protein into modular domains is a basic prerequisite to classify accurately structural units in biological molecules. Boundaries between domains are indicated by two similar amino acid sequence segments located within the same protein (repeats) or within homologous proteins at notably different distances from their respective N- or C-termini. Results: We have developed an automated method that combines such positional constraints derived from various detected pairwise sequence similarities to delineate the modular organisation of proteins. The procedure has been applied to a non-redundant data set of 26,990 proteins whose sequences were taken from the PIR and SWISS-PROT databanks and shared < 60% sequence identity amongst pairs. The resultant clustering, delineation and multiple alignment of 24,380 sequence fragments yielded a new database of 4364 domain families. Comparison of the domain collection with that of PRODOM indicates a clear improvement in the number and size of domain families, domain boundaries and multiple sequence alignments. The accuracy and sinsitivity of the method are illustrated by results obtained for ankyrin-like repeats and EGF-like modules.

abstract={The U1 snRNP functions to nucleate spliceosome assembly on newly transcribed pre-mRNA. Saccharomyces cerevisiae is unusual among eukaryotes in the greatly extended length of its U1 snRNA and the apparent increased polypeptide complexity of the corresponding U1 snRNP. In this paper, we report the identification of a novel U1 snRNP protein, Prp42p, with unexpected properties. Prp42p was identified by its surprising structural similarity to the essential U1 snRNP protein, Prp39p. Both Prp39p and Prp42p possess multiple copies of a variant tetratricopeptide repeat, an element implicated in a wide range of protein assembly events. Yeast strains depleted of Prp42p by transcriptional repression of a GAL1::PRP42 fusion gene arrest for Splicing prior to pre-mRNA 5' splice site cleavage. Prp42p was not observed in a recent biochemical analysis of purified U1 snRNPs from S. cerevisiae (28). Nevertheless, antibodies directed against an epitope-tagged version of Prp42p specifically precipitate U1 snRNA from yeast extracts. Furthermore, Prp42p is required for U1 snRNP biogenesis, because yeast strains depleted of Prp42p formed incomplete U1 snRNPs that failed to produce stable complexes with pre-mRNA in vitro. The evidence shows that Prp39p and Prp42p are both required to configure the atypical yeast U1 snRNP into a structure compatible with its evolutionarily conserved role in pre-mRNA splicing.},

abstract={In vivo, nucleosomes are formed rapidly on newly synthesized DNA after polymerase passage. Previously, a protein complex from human cells, termed chromatin assembly factor-I (CAF-I), was isolated that assembles nucleosomes preferentially onto SV40 DNA templates that undergo replication in vitro. Using a similar assay, we now report the purification of CAF-I from the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Amino acid sequence data from purified yeast CAF-I led to identification of the genes encoding each subunit in the yeast genome data base. The CAC1 and CAC2 (chromatin assembly complex) genes encode proteins similar to the p150 and p60 subunits of human CAF-I, respectively. The gene encoding the p50 subunit of yeast CAF-I (CAC3) is similar to the human p48 CAF-I subunit and was identified previously as MSI1, a member of a highly conserved subfamily of WD repeat proteins implicated in histone function in several organisms. Thus, CAF-I has been conserved functionally and structurally from yeast to human cells. Genes encoding the CAF-I subunits (collectively referred to as CAC genes) are not essential for cell viability. However, deletion of any CAC gene causes an increase in sensitivity to ultraviolet radiation, without significantly increasing sensitivity to gamma rays. This is consistent with previous biochemical data demonstrating the ability of CAF-I to assemble nucleosomes on templates undergoing nucleotide excision repair. Deletion of CAC genes also strongly reduces silencing of genes adjacent to telomeric DNA; the CAC1 gene is identical to RLF2 (Rap1p localization factor-2), a gene required for the normal distribution of the telomere-binding Rap1p protein within the nucleus. Together, these data suggest that CAF-I plays a role in generating chromatin structures in vivo.},

abstract={The central pair of microtubules and their associated structures play a significant role in regulating flagellar motility. To begin a molecular analysis of these components, we generated central apparatus-defective mutants in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii using insertional mutagenesis. One paralyzed mutant recovered in our screen contains an allele of a previously identified mutation, pf20. Mutant cells have paralyzed flagella, and the entire central apparatus is missing in isolated axonemes. We have cloned the wild-type PF20 gene and confirmed its identity by rescuing the pf20 mutant phenotype upon transformation. Rescued transformants were wild type in motility and in axonemal ultrastructure. A cDNA clone containing a single, long open reading frame was obtained and sequenced. Database searches using the predicted 606-amino acid sequence of PF20 indicate that the protein contains five contiguous WD repeats. These repeats are found in a number of proteins with diverse cellular functions including β-transducin and dynein intermediate chains. An antibody was raised against a fusion protein expressed from the cloned cDNA. Immunogold labeling of wild-type axonemes indicates that the PF20 protein is localized along the length of the C2 microtubule on the intermicrotubule bridges connecting the two central microtubules. We suggest that the PF20 gene product is a new member of the family of WD repeat proteins and is required for central microtubule assembly and/or stability and flagellar motility.},

abstract={The E2a-Pbx1 oncoprotein contains the transactivation domain of E2a joined to the DNA-binding homeo-domain (HD) of Pbx1. In mice, E2a-Pbx1 transforms T lymphoblasts and fibroblasts and blocks myeloblast differentiation. Pbx1 and E2a-Pbx1 bind DNA as heterodimers with other HD proteins whose expression is tissue specific. While the transactivation domain of E2a is required for all forms of transformation, DNA binding by the Pbx1 HD is essential for blocking myeloblast differentiation but dispensable for fibroblast or T-lymphoblast transformation. These properties suggest (i) that E2a-Pbx1 causes cellular transformation by activating gene transcription, (ii) that transcription of E2a-Pbx1 target genes is normally regulated by ubiquitous Pbx proteins and tissue-specific partners, and (iii) that DNA-binding mutants of E2a-Pbx1 activate a subset of all gene targets. To test these predictions, genes induced in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts by E2a-Pbx1 were identified and examined for tissue- and stage-specific expression and their differential abilities to be upregulated by E2a-Pbx1 in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts and myeloblasts and by a DNA-binding mutant of E2a-Pbx1 in NIH 3T3 cells. Of 12 RNAs induced by E2a-Pbx1, 4 encoded known proteins (a J-C region of the immunoglobulin kappa light chain, natriuretic peptide receptor C, mitochondrial fumarase, and the 3',5'-cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase, PDE1A) and 5 encoded new proteins related to angiogenin, ion channels, villin, epidermal growth factor repeat proteins, and the human 2.19 gene product. Expression of many of these genes was tissue specific or developmentally regulated, and most were not expressed in fibroblasts, indicating that E2a-Pbx1 can induce ectopic expression of genes associated with lineage-specific differentiation.},

abstract={The plakoglobin/armadillo multigene family comprises many proteins widely differing in sizes and functions which have in common a variable number of tandemly repeated arm sequences of about 42 amino acids (aa). In a search for proteins with sequence homology to the desmosomal-plaque-associated arm-repeat-containing protein, plakophilin 1, we have identified a novel plakoglobin/armadillo protein. This new member of the multigene family is predominantly, if not exclusively, expressed in neural and neuroendocrine tissues, hence the name neural plakophilin-related arm-repeat protein (NPRAP). The murine cDNA codes for a protein of 1247 aa, with a predicted molecular weight of 135 kDa and a pI of 7.57. The orthologous human protein differs only in a few aa, indicative of the evolutinary stability of NPRAP. In human and murine cDNAs, we have found different transcripts of the NPRAP gene, suggesting that in each species the protein exists in at least two isoforms. The NPRA protein contains three different regions: a 528-aa amino-terminal 'head' domain, including a potential coiled-coil-forming ex-helix segment, a central domain with 10 imperfect arm-repeat units, and a 212-aa carboxy-terminal 'tail' domain. By aa sequence, NPRAP is highly homologous to three proteins: p120(cas), p0071 and ARVCF; which represent a distinct subgroup within the plakoglobin/armadillo family. By in situ hybridisation and immunofluorescence microscopy using NPRAP-specific antibodies, we have demonstrated NPRAP and its mRNA in the perikarya of various kinds of CNS neurons in embryonic and adult mice, but minimal amounts have also been detected by immunoblot analysis in some other tissues containing neural or neuroendocrine elements. We have not seen significant enrichment of NPRAP at cell junctions or in nuclei. Possible NPRAP functions are discussed and the correlation of NPRAP synthesis with neuronal differentiation processes is emphasized.},

Here, we report the identification and characterization of an essential gene from Schizosaccharomyces pombe, sop2+, a mutation in which rescues the temperature-sensitive lethality of a profilin mutation, cdc3-124. The sop2-l mutant is defective for cell elongation and septation, suggesting that it is involved in multiple cortical actin-requiring processes. Consistent with a role in actin cytoskeletal function, negative interactions have been identified between sop2-l and act1-48, a mutant allele of actin. Sop2p is a novel 377 amino acid polypeptide with similarity to proteins of the β-transducin repeat family. Sop2p-related proteins have been identified by sequencing projects in diverse species, and we have isolated a human cDNA highly related to sop2 +, SOP2 Hs, which functionally complements the sop2-l mutation. Sop2p proteins from all species contain peptide sequences identical or highly similar to two peptide sequences from an Acanthamoeba β-transducin repeat protein present in the profilin binding complex. Biochemical analyses demonstrate that Sop2p is present in a complex which also contains the actin-related protein, Arp3p. Immunofluorescence studies reveal the presence of Sop2p in (i) punctate structures distributed throughout the cell, (ii) cables that extend the length of the cell, and (iii) a medial band in a small percentage of septating cells. Collectively these data demonstrate the interaction of Sop2p with Arp3p, profilin and actin.},

abstract={The detection and alignment of locally conserved regions (motifs) in multiple sequences can provide insight into protein structure, function, and evolution. A new Gibbs sampling algorithm is described that detects motif‐encoding regions in sequences and optimally partitions them into distinct motif models; this is illustrated using a set of immunoglobulin fold proteins. When applied to sequences sharing a single motif, the sampler can be used to classify motif regions into related submodels, as is illustrated using helix‐turn‐helix DNA‐binding proteins. Other statistically based procedures are described for searching a database for sequences matching motifs found by the sampler. When applied to a set of 32 very distantly related bacterial integral outer membrane proteins, the sampler revealed that they share a subtle, repetitive motif. Although BLAST (Altschul SF et al., 1990, J Mol Biol 215:403–410) fails to detect significant pairwise similarity between any of the sequences, the repeats present in these outer membrane proteins, taken as a whole, are highly significant (based on a generally applicable statistical test for motifs described here). Analysis of bacterial porins with known trimeric β‐barrel structure and related proteins reveals a similar repetitive motif corresponding to alternating membrane‐spanning β‐strands. These β‐strands occur on the membrane interface (as opposed to the trimeric interface) of the β‐barrel. The broad conservation and structural location of these repeats suggests that they play important functional roles. Copyright © 1995 The Protein Society},

abstract={This paper reports the molecular cloning of a novel gene in the mouse that shows structural similarities to the microfibril protein fibrillin and to the latent transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) binding protein (LTBP), a component of the latent TGF-β complex. The gene was initially isolated during a low stringency polymerase chain reaction screen of a NIH 3T3 cell cDNA library using primers that amplify a human fibrillin-1 epidermal growth factor-like repeat. Three lines of evidence suggest that the mouse gene is a third member of the LTBP gene family, which we designate LTBP-3. First, the deduced polypeptide, which consists of 15 epidermal growth factor-like repeats, 3 TGF binding protein repeats, and 2 proline- and glycine-rich sequences, shows 38.4% identity with LTBP-1 but only 27% identity with fibrillin-1. Second, the gene appears to be co-expressed in developing mouse tissues with TGF-β. Third, immunoprecipitation studies using mouse preosteoblast MC3T3-E1 cells and a specific anti-peptide polyclonal antiserum reveal that the mouse polypeptide forms a complex with the TGF-β1 precursor. Finally, we note that the LTBP-3 gene was recently localized to a distinct genetic locus (Li, X., Yin, W., Perez-Jurado, L., Bonadio, J. and Francke, U. (1995) Mamm. Genome 6, 42-45). Identification of a third binding protein provides further insight into a mechanism by which latent TGF-β complexes can be targeted to connective tissue matrices and cells.},

The predicted protein contains ten 34-amino acid repeats characteristic of the tetratricopeptide repeat protein family. The sequence homology and organization of the 10 repeats are similar to those of the nuc2 protein of fission yeast and bimA protein of Aspergillus, which suggests that the newly identified protein could be the human homologue of nuc2 (H-NUC). Consistent with this notion, the M(r) 95,000 H-NUC is a nuclear protein with DNA binding activity. This protein binds to hypophosphorylated Rb protein in a region indistinguishable from that to which SV40 large T antigen binds. However, Rb also binds to H-NUC at the tetratricopeptide repeat motif, a region which contains sequences different from the binding motifs of either T-antigen or E2F-1. To mimic the temperature-sensitive mutant of yeast nuc2, an H-NUC mutant was made in which the highly conserved glycine 640 residue was changed to aspartic acid. In contrast to wild-type H-NUC, the mutant was temperature sensitive in binding to Rb protein. These results, taken together, suggest that the interaction between H-NUC and Rb may be significant.},

We show that the purified CACT-Bgl protein can bind specifically to dorsal and, using circular dichroism spectroscopy, that the protein adopts a largely α-helical secondary structure. A further analysis of the ankyrin repeat domains of cactus, using an improved secondary structure prediction program indicates that the N-terminal of the repeat will form into a loop structure and the C-terminal section into an interrupted, amphipathic α-helix.

abstract={Until recently mucin tandem repeat protein cores were believed to exist in random-coil conformations and to attain structure solely by the addition of carbohydrates to serine and threonine residues. Matsushima et al. (Proteins Struct Funct Genet., 7: 125-155, 1990) recently proposed a model of the secondary structure of proline rich tandem repeat proteins that has challenged this idea, especially for the case of the human polymorphic epithelial mucin encoded by the muc-1 gene. We report here results of structural analyses of the muc-1 protein core by using synthetic peptide analogues. Synthetic peptides were prepared to correspond to one-, two-, and three-tandem repeats of muc-1. Results of one- and two-dimensional ‘H NMR correlation spectroscopy on these peptides confirm that the muc-1 protein core is not in a random-coil secondary structure. Long-lived amide protons are protected in D20, and increasing spectral complexity in the region of the β-protons of Asp 2 and His 15 reveals that structural changes are occurring as the number of repeats increases. The greatest changes occur when the number of repeats increases from one to two. These results are supported by the reactivity of a panel of monoclonal antibodies raised against tumor associated muc-1 with these synthetic peptides in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The primary immunodominant mucin epitope, PDTRP, does not appear to attain a native conformation in the single repeat peptide (20 amino acids, starting with P), but is expressed on peptides with multiple repeats. Intrinsic viscosity measurements of the peptide containing three repeats indicate that an ordered structure present in solution is rod shaped. The circular dichroism spectrum of the same peptide is dominated by proline in the trans conformation. These results are all consistent with the prediction that the muc-1 tandem repeat polypeptide core forms a polyproline β-turn helix. © 1993, American Association for Cancer Research.

abstract={We report the identification of a previously unknown gene, inIA, which is necessary for the gram-positive intracellular pathogen Listeria monocytogenes to invade cultured epithelial cells. The inIA region was localized by transposon mutagenesis, cloned, and sequenced. inIA was introduced into Listeria innocua and shown to confer on this normally noninvasive species the ability to enter cells. Sequencing of inIA predicts an 80 kd protein, internalin. Two-thirds of internalin is made up of two regions of repeats, region A and region B, and the C-terminus of the molecule is similar to that of surface proteins from gram-positive cocci. Internalin has a high content of threonine and serine residues, and the repeat motif of region A has regularly spaced leucine residues. As evidenced by Southern blot analysis, inIA is part of a gene family. One of them is the gene situated directly downstream of inIA, called inIB, which also encodes a leucine-rich repeat protein. © 1991.},
