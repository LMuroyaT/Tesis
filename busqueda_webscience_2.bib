Abstract = {{WD40 repeat-containing proteins (WD40 proteins) serve as versatile
   scaffolds for protein-protein interactions, modulating a variety of
   cellular processes such as plant stress and hormone responses. Here we
   report the identification of a WD40 protein, XIW1 (for XPO1-interacting
   WD40 protein 1), which positively regulates the abscisic acid (ABA)
   response in Arabidopsis. XIW1 is located in the cytoplasm and nucleus.
   We found that it interacts with the nuclear transport receptor XPO1 and
   is exported by XPO1 from the nucleus. Mutation of XIW1 reduces the
   induction of ABA-responsive genes and the accumulation of ABA
   Insensitive 5 (ABI5), causing mutant plants with ABA-insensitive
   phenotypes during seed germination and seedling growth, and decreased
   drought stress resistance. ABA treatment upregulates the expression of
   XIW1, and both ABA and abiotic stresses promote XIW1 accumulation in the
   nucleus, where it interacts with ABI5. Loss of XIW1 function results in
   rapid proteasomal degradation of ABI5. Taken together, these findings
   suggest that XIW1 is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein and plays a
   positive role in ABA responses by interacting with and maintaining the
   stability of ABI5 in the nucleus.}},

Abstract = {{Maize kernel size and weight are essential contributors to its yield. So
   the identification of the genes controlling kernel size and weight can
   give us a chance to gain the yield. Here, we identified a small kernel
   mutant, Zea mays small kernel 9 (Zmsmk9), in maize. Cytological
   observation showed that the development of the endosperm and embryo was
   delayed in Zmsmk9 mutants at the early stages, resulting in a small
   kernel phenotype. Interestingly, despite substantial variation in kernel
   size, the germination of Zmsmk9 seeds was comparable to that of WT, and
   could develop into normal plants with upright leaf architecture. We
   cloned Zmsmk9 via map-based cloning. ZmSMK9 encodes a P-type
   pentatricopeptide repeat protein that targets to mitochondria, and is
   involved in RNA splicing in mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase5 (nad5)
   intron-1 and intron-4. Consistent with the delayed development
   phenotype, transcriptome analysis of 12-DAP endosperm showed that starch
   and zeins biosynthesis related genes were dramatically down regulated in
   Zmsmk9, while cell cycle and cell growth related genes were dramatically
   increased. As a result, ZmSMK9 is a novel gene required for the splicing
   of nad5 intron-1 and intron-4, kernel development, and plant
   architecture in maize.}},

Abstract = {{Recombinant therapeutic proteins are playing an ever-increasing role in
   the clinic. High-affinity binding candidates can be produced in a
   high-throughput manner through the process of selection and evolution
   from large libraries, but the structures of the complexes with target
   protein can only be determined for a small number of them in a costly,
   low-throughput manner, typically by x-ray crystallography. Reliable
   modeling of complexes would greatly help to understand their mode of
   action and improve them by further engineering, for example, by
   designing bi-paratopic binders. Designed ankyrin repeat proteins
   (DARPins) are one such class of antibody mimetics that have proven
   useful in the clinic, in diagnostics and research. Here we have
   developed a standardized procedure to model DARPin-target complexes that
   can be used to predict the structures of unknown complexes. It requires
   only the sequence of a DARPin and a structure of the unbound target. The
   procedure includes homology modeling of the DARPin, modeling of the
   flexible parts of a target, rigid body docking to ensembles of the
   target and docking with a partially flexible backbone. For a set of
   diverse DARPin-target complexes tested it generated a single model of
   the complex that well approximates the native state of the complex. We
   provide a protocol that can be used in a semi-automated way and with
   tools that are freely available. The presented concepts should help to
   accelerate the development of novel bio-therapeutics for scaffolds with
   similar properties. Crown Copyright (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Designed armadillo repeat proteins (dArmRPs) are modular peptide binders
   composed of N- and C-terminal capping repeats Y and A and a variable
   number of internal modules M that each specifically recognize two amino
   acids of the target peptide. Complementary fragments of dArmRPs obtained
   by splitting the protein between helices H1 and H2 of an internal module
   show conditional and specific assembly only in the presence of a target
   peptide (Michel, E., Pluckthun, A., and Zerbe, O. (2018). Peptide-guided
   assembly of repeat protein fragments. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 57,
   4576-4579). Here, we investigate dArmRP fragments that already
   spontaneously assemble with high affinity, e.g. those obtained from
   splits between entire modules or between helices H2 and H3. We find that
   the interaction of the peptide with the assembled fragments induces
   distal conformational rearrangements that suggest an induced fit on a
   global protein level. A population analysis of an equimolar mixture of
   an N-terminal and three C-terminal fragments with various affinities for
   the target peptide revealed predominant assembly of the weakest peptide
   binder. However, adding a target peptide to this mixture altered the
   population of the protein complexes such that the combination with the
   highest affinity for the peptide increased and becomes predominant when
   adding excess of peptide, highlighting the feasibility of
   peptide-induced enrichment of best binders from intermodular fragment
   mixtures.}},

Abstract = {{Protein O-glycosylation is an important post-translational modification
   in all organisms, but deciphering the specific functions of these
   glycans is difficult due to their structural complexity. Understanding
   the glycosylation of mucin-like proteins presents a particular challenge
   as they are modified numerous times with both the enzymes involved and
   the glycosylation patterns being poorly understood. Here we
   systematically explored the O-glycosylation pathway of a mucin-like
   serine-rich repeat protein PsrP from the human pathogen Streptococcus
   pneumoniae TIGR4. Previous works have assigned the function of 3 of the
   10 glycosyltransferases thought to modify PsrP, GtfA/B, and Gtf3 as
   catalyzing the first two reactions to form a unified disaccharide core
   structure. We now use in vivo and in vitro glycosylation assays combined
   with hydrolytic activity assays to identify the glycosyltransferases
   capable of decorating this core structure in the third and fourth steps
   of glycosylation. Specifically, the full-length GlyE and GlyG proteins
   and the GlyD DUF1792 domain participate in both steps, whereas
   full-length GlyA and the GlyD GT8 domain catalyze only the fourth step.
   Incorporation of different sugars to the disaccharide core structure at
   multiple sites along the serine-rich repeats results in a highly
   polymorphic product. Furthermore, crystal structures of apo- and
   UDP-complexed GlyE combined with structural analyses reveal a novel
   Rossmann-fold ``add-on{''} domain that we speculate to function as a
   universal module shared by GlyD, GlyE, and GlyA to forward the peptide
   acceptor from one enzyme to another. These findings define the complete
   glycosylation pathway of a bacterial glycoprotein and offer a testable
   hypothesis of how glycosyltransferase coordination facilitates glycan
   assembly.}},

Abstract = {{Pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins comprise a large family of
   helical repeat proteins that influence gene expression in mitochondria
   and chloroplasts. PPR tracts can bind RNA via a modular one repeat-one
   nucleotide mechanism in which the nucleotide is specified by the
   identities of several amino acids in each repeat. This mode of
   recognition, the so-called PPR code, offers opportunities for the
   prediction of native PPR binding sites and the design of proteins to
   bind specified RNAs. However, a deep understanding of the parameters
   that dictate the affinity and specificity of PPR-RNA interactions is
   necessary to realize these goals. We report a comprehensive analysis of
   the sequence specificity of PPR10, a protein that binds similar RNA
   sequences of similar to 18 nucleotides (nt) near the chloroplast atpH
   and psaJ genes in maize. We assessed the contribution of each nucleotide
   in the atpH binding site to PPR10 affinity in vitro by analyzing the
   effects of single-nucleotide changes at each position. In a
   complementary approach, the RNAs bound by PPR10 from partially
   randomized RNA pools were analyzed by deep sequencing. The results
   revealed three patches in which nucleotide identity has a major impact
   on binding affinity. These include 5 nt for which protein contacts were
   not observed in a PPR10-RNA crystal structure and 4 nt that are not
   explained by current views of the PPR code. These findings highlight
   aspects of PPR-RNA interactions that pose challenges for binding site
   prediction and design.}},

Abstract = {{Large-scale genome sequencing holds great promise for the interpretation
   of protein structures through the discovery of many, rare functional
   variants in the human population. However, because protein-coding
   regions are under high selective constraints, these variants occur at
   low frequencies, such that there is often insufficient statistics for
   downstream calculations. To address this problem, we develop the
   Intensification approach, which uses the modular structure of repeat
   protein domains to amplify signals of selection from population genetics
   and traditional interspecies conservation. In particular, we are able to
   aggregate variants at the codon level to identify important positions in
   repeat domains that show strong conservation signals. This allows us to
   compare conservation over different evolutionary timescales. It also
   enables us to visualize population-genetic measures on protein
   structures. We make available the Intensification results as an online
   resource (http://intensification.gersteinlab.org) and illustrate the
   approach through a case study on the tetratricopeptide repeat. (C) 2016

   RepeatsDB with an improved classification schema including high quality
   annotations for similar to 5400 protein structures. RepeatsDB 2.0
   features information on start and end positions for the repeat regions
   and units for all entries. The extensive growth of repeat unit
   characterization was possible by applying the novel ReUPred annotation
   method over the entire Protein Data Bank, with data quality is
   guaranteed by an extensive manual validation for >60\% of the entries.
   The updated web interface includes a new search engine for complex
   queries and a fully re-designed entry page for a better overview of
   structural data. It is now possible to compare unit positions, together
   with secondary structure, fold information and Pfam domains. Moreover, a

Abstract = {{Fanconi anemia complementation groups - I (FANCI) protein facilitates
   DNA ICL (Inter-Cross-link) repair and plays a crucial role in genomic
   integrity. FANCI is a 1328 amino acids protein which contains armadillo
   (ARM) repeats and EDGE motif at the C-terminus. ARM repeats are
   functionally diverse and evolutionarily conserved domain that plays a
   pivotal role in protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions.
   Considering the importance of ARM repeats, we have explored
   comprehensive in silico and in vitro approach to examine folding
   pattern. Size exclusion chromatography, dynamic light scattering (DLS)
   and glutaraldehyde crosslinking studies suggest that FANCI ARM repeat
   exist as monomer as well as in oligomeric forms. Circular dichroism (CD)
   and fluorescence spectroscopy results demonstrate that protein has
   predominantly alpha- helices and well-folded tertiary structure. DNA
   binding was analysed using electrophoretic mobility shift assay by
   autoradiography. Temperature-dependent CD, Fluorescence spectroscopy and
   DLS studies concluded that protein unfolds and start forming oligomer
   from 30 degrees C. The existence of stable portion within FANCI ARM
   repeat was examined using limited proteolysis and mass spectrometry. The
   normal mode analysis, molecular dynamics and principal component
   analysis demonstrated that helix-turn-helix (HTH) motif present in ARM
   repeat is highly dynamic and has anti-correlated motion. Furthermore,
   FANCI ARM repeat has HTH structural motif which binds to double-stranded
   DNA.}},

Abstract = {{PRELP (proline/arginine-rich end leucine-rich repeat protein) is a
   member of the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) family of extracellular matrix
   proteins in connective tissue. In contrast with other members of the
   family, the N-terminal domain of PRELP has a high content of proline and
   positively charged amino acids. This domain has previously been shown to
   bind chondrocytes and to inhibit osteoclast differentiation. In the
   present study, we show that PRELP mediates cell adhesion by binding to
   cell-surface glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). Thus, rat skin fibroblasts
   (RSFs) bound to full-length PRELP and to the N-terminal part of PRELP
   alone, but not to truncated PRELP lacking the positively charged
   N-terminal region. Cell attachment to PRELP was inhibited by addition of
   soluble heparin or heparan sulfate (HS), by blocking sulfation of the
   fibroblasts or by treating the cells with a combination of
   chondroitinase and heparinase. Using affinity chromatography, we
   identified syndecan-1, syndecan-4 and glypican-1 as cell-surface
   proteoglycans (PGs) binding to the N-terminal part of PRELP. Finally, we
   show that the N-terminal domain of PRELP in combination with the
   integrin-binding domain of fibronectin, but neither of the fragments
   alone, induced fibroblast focal adhesion formation. These findings
   provide support for a role of the N-terminal region of PRELP as an
   important regulator of cell adhesion and behaviour, which may be of
   importance in pathological conditions.}},

Abstract = {{The mitochondrion is an important power generator in most eukaryotic
   cells. To preserve its function, many essential nuclear-encoded factors
   play specific roles in mitochondrial RNA metabolic processes, including
   RNA editing. RNA editing consists of post-transcriptional deamination,
   which alters specific nucleotides in transcripts to mediate gene
   expression. In plant cells, many pentatricopeptide repeat proteins
   (PPRs) participate in diverse organellar RNA metabolic processes, but
   only PLS-type PPRs are involved in RNA editing. Here, we report a P-type
   PPR protein from Arabidopsis thaliana, P-type PPR-Modulating Editing
   (PPME), which has a distinct role in mitochondrial nad1 RNA editing via
   RNA binding activity. In the homozygous ppme mutant, cytosine
   (C)-to-uracil (U) conversions at both the nad1-898 and 937 sites were
   abolished, disrupting Arg(300)-to-Trp(300) and Pro(313)-to-Ser(313)
   amino acid changes in the mitochondrial NAD1 protein. NAD1 is a critical
   component of mitochondrial respiration complex I; its activity is
   severely reduced in the homozygous ppme mutant, resulting in
   significantly altered growth and development. Both abolished RNA editing
   and defective complex I activity were completely rescued by CaMV 35S
   promoter- and PPME native promoter-driven PPME genomic fragments tagged
   with GFP in a homozygous ppme background. Our experimental results
   demonstrate a distinct role of a P-type PPR protein, PPME, in RNA
   editing in plant organelles.}},

Abstract = {{The protein arginine methyltransferase PRMT5 is complexed with the WD
   repeat protein MEP50 (also known as Wdr77 or androgen coactivator p44)
   in vertebrates in a tetramer of heterodimers. MEP50 is hypothesized to
   be required for protein substrate recruitment to the catalytic domain of
   PRMT5. Here we demonstrate that the cross-dimer MEP50 is paired with its
   cognate PRMT5 molecule to promote histone methylation. We employed
   qualitative methylation assays and a novel ultrasensitive continuous
   assay to measure enzyme kinetics. We demonstrate that neither
   full-length human PRMT5 nor the Xenopus laevis PRMT5 catalytic domain
   has appreciable protein methyltransferase activity. We show that
   histones H4 and H3 bind PRMT5-MEP50 more efficiently compared with
   histone H2A(1-20) and H4(1-20) peptides. Histone binding is mediated
   through histone fold interactions as determined by competition
   experiments and by high density histone peptide array interaction
   studies. Nucleosomes are not a substrate for PRMT5-MEP50, consistent
   with the primary mode of interaction via the histone fold of H3-H4,
   obscured by DNA in the nucleosome. Mutation of a conserved arginine
   (Arg-42) on the MEP50 insertion loop impaired the PRMT5-MEP50 enzymatic
   efficiency by increasing its histone substrate K-m comparable with that
   of Caenorhabditis elegans PRMT5. We show that PRMT5-MEP50 prefers
   unmethylated substrates, consistent with a distributive model for
   dimethylation and suggesting discrete biological roles for mono- and
   dimethylarginine-modified proteins. We propose a model in which MEP50
   and PRMT5 simultaneously engage the protein substrate, orienting its
   targeted arginine to the catalytic site.}},

Abstract = {{The biogenesis and activity of chloroplasts in both vascular plants and
   algae depends on an intracellular network of nucleus-encoded,
   trans-acting factors that control almost all aspects of organellar gene
   expression. Most of these regulatory factors belong to the helical
   repeat protein superfamily, which includes tetratricopeptide repeat,
   pentatricopeptide repeat, and the recently identified octotricopeptide
   repeat (OPR) proteins. Whereas green algae express many different OPR
   proteins, only a single orthologous OPR protein is encoded in the
   genomes of most land plants. Here, we report the characterization of the
   only OPR protein in Arabidopsis thaliana, RAP, which has previously been
   implicated in plant pathogen defense. Loss of RAP led to a severe defect
   in processing of chloroplast 16S rRNA resulting in impaired chloroplast
   translation and photosynthesis. In vitro RNA binding and RNase
   protection assays revealed that RAP has an intrinsic and specific RNA
   binding capacity, and the RAP binding site was mapped to the 5' region
   of the 16S rRNA precursor. Nucleoid localization of RAP was shown by
   transient green fluorescent protein import assays, implicating the
   nucleoid as the site of chloroplast rRNA processing. Taken together, our
   data indicate that the single OPR protein in Arabidopsis is important
   for a basic process of chloroplast biogenesis.}},

Abstract = {{The WD-repeat (WDR) proteins comprise an astonishingly diverse
   superfamily of regulatory proteins. To date, genome-wide
   characterization of this family has only been conducted in Arabidopsis
   and little is known about WDR genes in cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.).
   This study identified 191 cucumber WDR genes in the latest cucumber
   genome and the CsWDR family contained a smaller number of identified
   genes compared to Arabidopsis. The results of this study were also
   supported by genome distribution and gene duplication analysis.
   Phylogenetic analysis showed that the WDR proteins could be classified
   into 21 subgroups. Moreover, an additional 12 AtWDR proteins were also
   identified and a complete overview of this gene family in Arabidopsis is
   presented, including the phylogeny, chromosome locations and duplication
   events. In addition, a comparative analysis between these genes in
   cucumber and Arabidopsis was performed and it suggested that there was
   strong gene conservation and that there was an expansion of particular
   functional genes during the evolution of the two species. The transcript
   abundance level analysis during abiotic stress (NaCl, ABA and low
   temperature treatments) identified six CsWDR genes that responded to one
   or more treatments. Tissue-specific expression profiles of these six
   genes were also analyzed. This study has produced a comparative genomics
   analysis of the WDR gene family in cucumber and Arabidopsis and provides
   the first steps towards the selection of CsWDR genes for cloning and
   functional dissection that can be used in further studies into their
   roles in cucumber stress resistance.}},

Abstract = {{RepeatsDB (http://repeatsdb.bio.unipd.it/) is a database of annotated
   tandem repeat protein structures. Tandem repeats pose a difficult
   problem for the analysis of protein structures, as the underlying
   sequence can be highly degenerate. Several repeat types haven been
   studied over the years, but their annotation was done in a case-by-case
   basis, thus making large-scale analysis difficult. We developed
   RepeatsDB to fill this gap. Using state-of-the-art repeat detection
   methods and manual curation, we systematically annotated the Protein
   Data Bank, predicting 10 745 repeat structures. In all, 2797 structures
   were classified according to a recently proposed classification schema,
   which was expanded to accommodate new findings. In addition, detailed
   annotations were performed in a subset of 321 proteins. These
   annotations feature information on start and end positions for the
   repeat regions and units. RepeatsDB is an ongoing effort to
   systematically classify and annotate structural protein repeats in a
   consistent way. It provides users with the possibility to access and
   download high-quality datasets either interactively or programmatically
   through web services.}},

Abstract = {{Pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins are sequence-specific
   RNA-binding proteins that form a pervasive family of proteins conserved
   in yeast, plants, and humans. The plant PPR proteins are grouped mainly
   into the P and PLS classes. Here, we report the crystal structure of a
   PLS-class PPR protein from Arabidopsis thaliana called THA8L (THA8-like)
   at 2.0 angstrom. THA8L resembles THA8 (thylakoid assembly 8), a protein
   that is required for the splicing of specific group II introns of genes
   involved in biogenesis of chloroplast thylakoid membranes. The THA8L
   structure contains three P-type PPR motifs flanked by one L-type motif
   and one S-type motif. We identified several putative THA8L-binding
   sites, enriched with purine sequences, in the group II introns.
   Importantly, THA8L has strong binding preference for single-stranded RNA
   over single-stranded DNA or double-stranded RNA. Structural analysis
   revealed that THA8L contains two extensive patches of positively charged
   residues next to the residues that are proposed to comprise the
   RNA-binding codes. Mutations in these two positively charged patches
   greatly reduced THA8L RNA-binding activity. On the basis of these data,
   we constructed a model of THA8L-RNA binding that is dependent on two
   forces: one is the interaction between nucleotide bases and specific
   amino acids in the PPR motifs (codes), and the other is the interaction
   between the negatively charged RNA backbone and positively charged
   residues of PPR motifs. Together, these results further our
   understanding of the mechanism of PPR protein-RNA interactions.}},

   lead to unwarranted inflammation with hazardous outcomes. Mechanisms of
   restraining excessive inflammation and controlling homeostasis for
   innate immunity are the focus of intense study. Here we showed that
   LRRC33, a novel member of leucine-rich repeat (LRR) protein family,
   plays a critical role in desensitizing TLR signaling. LRRC33 is TLR
   homolog that contains 17 putative LRRs in the extracellular region but
   lacks a cytoplasmic Toll/IL-1 receptor (TIR) domain. Expression of
   LRRC33 appears to be ubiquitous with high level of expression found in
   bone marrow, thymus, liver, lung, intestine and spleen. The LRRs of
   LRRC33 is required for the interaction with TLR and its inhibitory
   effect on NF-kappa B and AP-1 activation as well as cytokine production.
   Our study sheds new insight into the TLR signaling and inflammatory
   response in development and human diseases. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{In flowering plants, RNA editing is a posttranscriptional mechanism that
   converts specific cytidines to uridines in both mitochondrial and
   plastidial transcripts, altering the information encoded by these genes.
   Here, we report the molecular characterization of the empty pericarp5
   (emp5) mutants inmaize (Zea mays). Null mutation of Emp5 results in
   abortion of embryo and endosperm development at early stages. Emp5
   encodes a mitochondrion-targeted DYW subgroup pentatricopeptide repeat
   (PPR) protein. Analysis of the mitochondrial transcripts revealed that
   loss of the EMP5 function abolishes the C-to-U editing of ribosomal
   protein L16 at the rpl16-458 site (100\% edited in the wild type),
   decreases the editing at nine sites in NADH dehydrogenase9 (nad9),
   cytochrome c oxidase3 (cox3), and ribosomal protein S12 (rps12), and
   surprisingly increases the editing at five sites of ATP synthase F0
   subunit a (atp6), apocytochrome b (cob), nad1, and rpl16. Mutant EMP5-4
   lacking the E+ and DYW domains still retains the substrate specificity
   and editing function, only at reduced efficiency. This suggests that the
   E+ and DYW domains of EMP5 are not essential to the EMP5 editing
   function but are necessary for efficiency. Analysis of the ortholog in
   rice (Oryza sativa) indicates that rice EMP5 has a conserved function in
   C-to-U editing of the rice mitochondrial rpl16-458 site. EMP5 knockdown
   expression in transgenics resulted in slow growth and defective seeds.
   These results demonstrate that Emp5 encodes a PPR-DYW protein that is
   required for the editing of multiple transcripts in mitochondria, and
   the editing events, particularly the C-to-U editing at the rpl16-458
   site, are critical to the mitochondrial functions and, hence, to seed
   development in maize.}},

Abstract = {{Pathogenesis of many bacterially-induced inflammatory diseases is driven
   by Toll-like receptor (TLR) mediated immune responses following
   recognition of bacterial factors by different TLRs. Periodontitis is a
   chronic inflammation of the tooth supporting apparatus often leading to
   tooth loss, and is caused by a Gram-negative bacterial consortium that
   includes Tannerella forsythia. This bacterium expresses a virulence
   factor, the BspA, which drives periodontal inflammation by activating
   TLR2. The N-terminal portion of the BspA protein comprises a
   leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain previously shown to be involved in the
   binding and activation of TLR2. The objective of the current study was
   to identify specific epitopes in the LRR domain of BspA that interact
   with TLR2. Our results demonstrate that a sequence motif GC(S/T)GLXSIT
   is involved in mediating the interaction of BspA with TLR2. Thus, our
   study has identified a peptide motif that mediates the binding of a
   bacterial protein to TLR2 and highlights the promiscuous nature of TLR2
   with respect to ligand binding. This work could provide a structural
   basis for designing peptidomimetics to modulate the activity of TLR2 in
   order to block bacterially-induced inflammation. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{Pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins are members of one of the
   largest nucleus-encoded protein families in plants. Here, we describe
   the previously uncharacterized maize (Zea mays) PPR gene, MPPR6, which
   was isolated from a Mutator-induced collection of maize kernel mutants
   by a cDNA-based forward genetic approach. Identification of a second
   mutant allele and cosegregation analysis confirmed correlation with the
   mutant phenotype. Histological investigations revealed that the mutation
   coincides with abnormities in the transfer cell layer, retardation of
   embryo development, and a considerable reduction of starch level. The
   function of MPPR6 is conserved across a wide phylogenetic distance as
   revealed by heterologous complementation of the Arabidopsis thaliana
   mutant in the orthologous APPR6 gene. MPPR6 appeared to be exclusively
   present in mitochondria. RNA coimmunoprecipitation and in vitro binding
   studies revealed a specific physical interaction of MPPR6 with the 59
   untranslated region of ribosomal protein S3 (rps3) mRNA. Mapping of
   transcript termini showed specifically extended rps3 59 ends in the
   mppr6 mutant. Considerable reduction of mitochondrial translation was
   observed, indicating loss of RPS3 function. This is consistent with the
   appearance of truncated RPS3 protein lacking the N terminus in mppr6.
   Our results suggest that MPPR6 is directly involved in 59 maturation and
   translation initiation of rps3 mRNA.}},

Abstract = {{In plant organelles, RNA editing alters specific cytidine residues to
   uridine in transcripts. All of the site-specificity factors of RNA
   editing identified so far are pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins. A
   defect in a specific PPR protein often impairs RNA editing at multiple
   sites, at which the cis-acting elements are not highly conserved. The
   molecular mechanism for sharing a single PPR protein over multiple sites
   is still unclear. We focused here on the PPR proteins OTP82 and CRR22,
   the putative target elements of which are, respectively, partially and
   barely conserved. Recombinant OTP82 specifically bound to the -15 to 0
   regions of its target sites. Recombinant CRR22 specifically bound to the
   -20 to 0 regions of the ndhB-7 and ndhD-5 sites and to the -17 to 0
   region of the rpoB-3 site. Taking this information together with the
   genetic data, we conclude that OTP82 and CRR22 act as site-specificity
   factors at multiple sites in plastids. In addition, the high-affinity
   binding of CRR22 to unrelated cis-acting elements suggests that only
   certain specific nucleotides in a cis-acting element are sufficient for
   high-affinity binding of a PPR protein. The cis-acting elements can
   therefore be rather divergent and still be recognized by a single PPR
   protein.}},

Abstract = {{The expressions of chloroplast and mitochondria genes are tightly
   controlled by numerous nuclear-encoded proteins, mainly at the
   post-transcriptional level. Recent analyses have identified a large,
   plant-specific family of pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) motif-containing
   proteins that are exclusively involved in RNA metabolism of organelle
   genes via sequence-specific RNA binding. A tandem array of PPR motifs
   within the protein is believed to facilitate the RNA interaction,
   although little is known of the mechanism. Here, we describe the RNA
   interacting framework of a PPR protein, Arabidopsis HCF152. First, we
   demonstrated that a Pfam model could be relevant to the PPR motif
   function. A series of proteins with two PPR motifs showed significant
   differences in their RNA binding affinities, indicating functional
   differences among PPR motifs. Mutagenesis and informatics analysis
   putatively identified five amino acids organizing its RNA binding
   surface {[}the 1st, 4th, 8th, 12th and `ii'(-2nd) amino acids] and their
   complex connections. SELEX (Systematic evolution of ligands by
   exponential enrichment) and nucleobase preference assays determined the
   nucleobases with high affinity for HCF152 and suggested several
   characteristic amino acids that may be involved in determining
   specificity and/or affinity of the PPR/RNA interaction.}},

   the dephosphorylation of a conserved regulatory motif, the hydrophobic
   motif, on the AGC kinases Akt, PKC, and S6 kinase, as well as an
   inhibitory site on the kinase Mst1, to inhibit cellular proliferation
   and induce apoptosis. The frequent deletion of PHLPP in cancer, coupled
   with the development of prostate tumors in mice lacking PHLPP1,
   identifies PHLPP as a novel tumor suppressor. This minireview discusses
   the structure, function, and regulation of PHLPP, with particular focus
   on its role in disease.}},

Abstract = {{Early embryogenesis is the most fundamental developmental process in
   biology. Screening of ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS)-mutagenized
   populations of Arabidopsis thaliana led to the identification of a
   zygote-lethal mutant emblyonic factor 19 (fac19) in which embryo
   development was arrested at the elongated zygote to octant stage. The
   number of endosperm nuclei decreased significantly in fac19 embryos.
   Genetic analysis showed fac19 was caused by a single recessive mutation
   with typical mendelian segregation, suggesting equal maternal and
   paternal contributions of FAC19 towards zygotic embryogenesis.
   Positional cloning showed that FAC19 encodes a putative mitochondria!
   protein with 16 conserved pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) motifs. The
   fac19 mutation caused a conversion from hydrophilic serine located in a
   previously unknown domain to hydrophobic leucine. Crosses between
   FAC19/fac19 and the T-DNA insertion mutants in the same gene failed to
   complement the fac19 defects, confirming the identity of the gene. This
   study revealed the critical importance of a PPR protein-mediated
   mitochondria! function in early embryogenesis.}},

Abstract = {{We applied molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the binding
   properties of a designed ankyrin repeat protein, the DARPin-CD4 complex.
   DARPin 23.2 has been reported to disturb the human immunodeficiency
   virus (HIV) viral entry process by Schweizer et al. The protein docking
   simulation was analysed by comparing the specific ankyrin binder (DARPin
   23.2) to an irrelevant control (2JAB) in forming a composite with CD4.
   To determine the binding free energy of both ankyrins, the MM/PBSA and
   MM/GBSA protocols were used. The free energy decomposition of both
   complexes were analysed to explore the role of certain amino acid
   residues in complex configuration. Interestingly, the molecular docking
   analysis of DARPin 23.2 revealed a similar CD4 interaction regarding the
   gp120 theoretical anchoring motif. In contrast, the binding of control
   ankyrin to CD4 occurred at a different location. This observation
   suggests that there is an advantage to the molecular modification of
   DARPin 23.2, an enhanced affinity for CD4. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{In plant organelles, RNA editing is a post-transcriptional mechanism
   that converts specific cytidines to uridines in RNA of both mitochondria
   and plastids, altering the information encoded by the gene. The cytidine
   to be edited is determined by a cis-element surrounding the editing site
   that is specifically recognized and bound by a trans-acting factor. All
   the trans-acting editing factors identified so far in plant organelles
   are members of a large protein family, the pentatricopeptide repeat
   (PPR) proteins. We have identified the Organelle Transcript Processing
   87 (OTP87) gene, which is required for RNA editing of the nad7-C24 and
   atp1-C1178 sites in Arabidopsis mitochondria. OTP87 encodes an
   E-subclass PPR protein with an unusually short E-domain. The recombinant
   protein expressed in Escherichia coli specifically binds to RNAs
   comprising 30 nucleotides upstream and 10 nucleotides downstream of the
   nad7-C24 and atp1-C1178 editing sites. The loss-of-function of OTP87
   results in small plants with growth and developmental delays. In the
   otp87 mutant, the amount of assembled respiratory complex V (ATP
   synthase) is highly reduced compared with the wild type suggesting that
   the amino acid alteration in ATP1 caused by loss of editing at the
   atp1-C1178 site affects complex V assembly in mitochondria.}},

Abstract = {{Splicing of plant organellar transcripts is facilitated by members of a
   large protein family, the pentatricopeptide repeat proteins. We have
   identified a pentatricopeptide repeat protein in a genetic screen for
   mutants resistant to inhibition of root growth by buthionine sulfoximine
   (BSO), an inhibitor of glutathione synthesis and consequently named BIR6
   (BSO-insensitive roots 6). BIR6 is involved in splicing of intron 1 of
   the mitochondrial nad7 transcript. Loss-of-function mutations in BIR6
   result in a strongly reduced accumulation of fully processed nad7
   transcript. This affects assembly of Complex I and results in moderate
   growth retardation. In agreement with disruption of Complex I function,
   the genes encoding alternative NADH oxidizing enzymes are induced in the
   mutant, and the mutant plants are less sensitive to mannitol and salt
   stress. Mutation in the BIR6 gene allowed normal root growth in presence
   of BSO and strongly attenuated depletion of glutathione content at these
   conditions. The same phenotype was observed with other mutants affected
   in function of Complex I, thus reinforcing the importance of Complex I
   function for cellular redox homeostasis.}},

Abstract = {{Leucine-rich repeat containing proteins are involved in immune response
   in many capacities. In insects, these include Toll-like receptors and
   the Anopheles gambiae proteins APL1 and LRIM1. Here we describe the
   identification and characterization of leureptin, a novel extracellular
   protein with 13 leucine-rich repeats from hemolymph of the insect
   Manduca sexta. After injection of bacteria, leureptin mRNA level
   increased in fat body, but protein levels in plasma decreased, an
   indication that leureptin is consumed during the immune response.
   Leureptin bound to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Microscopy using
   leureptin antiserum showed that leureptin associates with hemocytes
   after injection of bacteria, an indication that leureptin is involved in
   hemocyte responses to bacterial infection. Sequence database searches
   suggest similar proteins are present in other Lepidopteran species. (C)

Abstract = {{PRAME/MAPE/OIP4 is a germinal tissue-specific gene that is also
   expressed at high levels in haematological malignancies and solid
   tumours. The physiological functions of PRAME in normal and tumour cells
   are unknown, although a role in the regulation of retinoic acid
   signalling has been proposed. Sequence homology and structural
   predictions suggest that PRAME is related to the leucine-rich repeat
   (LRR) family of proteins, which have diverse functions. Here we review
   the current knowledge of the structure/function of PRAME and its
   relevance in leukaemia.}},

Abstract = {{In searching for new targets for antimalarials we investigated the
   biosynthesis of hypusine present in eukaryotic initiation factor-5A
   (eIF-5A) in Plasmodium. Here, we describe the cloning and expression of
   deoxyhypusine hydroxylase (DOHH), which completes the modi. cation of
   eIF-5A through hydroxylation of deoxyhypusine. The dohh cDNA sequence
   revealed an ORF of 1236 bp encoding a protein of 412 amino acids with a
   calculated molecular mass of 46.45 kDa and an isoelectric point of 4.96.
   Interestingly, DOHH from Plasmodium has a FASTA SCORE of only 27
   compared with its human ortholog and contains several matches similar to
   E-Z-type HEAT-like repeat proteins (IPR004155 (InterPro), PF03130
   (Pfam), SM00567 (SMART) present in the phycocyanin lyase subunits of
   cyanobacteria. Purified DOHH protein displayed hydroxylase activity in a
   novel in vitro DOHH assay, but phycocyanin lyase activity was absent.
   dohh is present as a single-copy gene and is transcribed in the asexual
   blood stages of the parasite. A signal peptide at the N-terminus might
   direct the protein to a different cellular compartment. During
   evolution, Plasmodium falciparum acquired an apicoplast that lost its
   photosynthetic function. It is possible that plasmodial DOHH arose from
   an E/F-type phycobilin lyase that gained a new role in hydroxylation.}},

Abstract = {{The transcription factor SKN-1 protects Caenorhabditis elegans from
   stress and promotes longevity. SKN-1 is regulated by diverse signals
   that control metabolism, development, and stress responses, but the
   mechanisms of regulation and signal integration are unknown. We screened
   the C. elegans genome for regulators of cytoprotective gene expression
   and identified a new SKN-1 regulatory pathway. SKN-1 protein levels,
   nuclear accumulation, and activity are repressed by the WD40 repeat
   protein WDR-23, which interacts with the CUL-4/DDB-1 ubiquitin ligase to
   presumably target the transcription factor for proteasomal degradation.
   WDR-23 regulates SKN-1 target genes downstream from p38
   mitogen-activated protein kinase, glycogen synthase kinase 3, and
   insulin-like receptor pathways, suggesting that phosphorylation of SKN-1
   may function to modify its interaction with WDR-23 and/or CUL-4/DDB-1.
   These findings define the mechanism of SKN-1 accumulation in the cell
   nucleus and provide a new mechanistic framework for understanding how
   phosphorylation signals are integrated to regulate stress resistance and
   longevity.}},

Abstract = {{Although cells of flowering plants lack a structurally defined
   microtubule-organizing center like the centrosome, organization of the
   spindles and phragmoplasts in mitosis is known to involve the
   evolutionarily conserved gamma -tubulin complex. We have investigated
   the function of Arabidopsis thaliana NEDD1, a WD40 repeat protein
   related to the animal NEDD1/GCP-WD protein, which interacts with the
   gamma-tubulin complex. The NEDD1 protein decorates spindle microtubules
   (MTs) preferentially toward spindle poles and phragmoplast MTs toward
   their minus ends. A T-DNA insertional allele of the single NEDD1 gene
   was isolated and maintained in heterozygous sporophytes, and NEDD1's
   function in cell division was analyzed in haploid microspores produced
   by the heterozygote. In approximately half of the dividing microspores
   exhibiting aberrant MT organization, spindles were no longer restricted
   to the cell periphery and became abnormally elongated. After mitosis,
   MTs aggregated between reforming nuclei but failed to appear in a
   bipolar configuration. Consequently, defective microspores did not form
   a continuous cell plate, and two identical nuclei were produced with no
   differentiation into generative and vegetative cells. Our results
   support the notion that the plant NEDD1 homolog plays a critical role in
   MT organization during mitosis, and its function is likely linked to
   that of the gamma-tubulin complex.}},

Volume = {{9}},

Abstract = {{A stable and robust trypsin-based biocatalytic system was developed and
   demonstrated for proteomic applications. The system utilizes polymer
   nanofibers coated with trypsin aggregates for immobilized protease
   digestions. After covalently attaching an initial layer of trypsin to
   the polymer nanofibers, highly concentrated trypsin molecules are
   crosslinked to the layered trypsin by way of a glutaraldehyde treatment.
   This process produced a 300-fold increase in trypsin activity compared
   with a conventional method for covalent trypsin immobilization, and
   proved to be robust in that it still maintained a high level of activity
   after a year of repeated recycling. This highly stable form of
   immobilized trypsin was resistant to autolysis, enabling repeated
   digestions of BSA over 40 days and successful peptide identification by
   LC-MS/MS. This active and stable form of immobilized trypsin was
   successfully employed in the digestion of yeast proteome extract with
   high reproducibility and within shorter time than conventional protein
   digestion using solution phase trypsin. Finally, the immobilized trypsin
   was resistant to proteolysis when exposed to other enzymes (i.e.,
   chymotrypsin), which makes it suitable for use in ``real-world{''}
   proteomic applications. Overall, the biocatalytic nanofibers with
   trypsin aggregate coatings proved to be an effective approach for
   repeated and automated protein digestion in proteomic analyses.}},

Abstract = {{RNA editing in flowering plant mitochondria alters 400 to 500
   nucleotides from C to U, changing the information content of most mRNAs
   and some tRNAs. So far, none of the specific or general factors
   responsible for RNA editing in plant mitochondria have been identified.
   Here, we characterize a nuclear-encoded gene that is involved in RNA
   editing of three specific sites in different mitochondrial mRNAs in
   Arabidopsis thaliana, editing sites rps4-956, nad7-963, and nad2-1160.
   The encoded protein MITOCHONDRIAL RNA EDITING FACTOR1 (MEF1) belongs to
   the DYW subfamily of pentatricopeptide repeat proteins. Amino acid
   identities altered in MEF1 from ecotype C24, in comparison to Columbia,
   lower the activity at these editing sites; single amino acid changes in
   mutant plants inactivate RNA editing. These variations most likely
   modify the affinity of the editing factor to the affected editing sites
   in C24 and in the mutant plants. Since lowered and even absent RNA
   editing is tolerated at these sites, the amino acid changes may be
   silent for the respective protein functions. Possibly more than these
   three identified editing sites are addressed by this first factor
   identified for RNA editing in plant mitochondria.}},

Abstract = {{The Notch ankyrin domain is a repeat protein whose folding has been
   characterized through equilibrium and kinetic measurements. In previous
   work, equilibrium folding free energies of truncated constructs were
   used to generate an experimentally determined folding energy landscape
   (Mello and Barrick, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 2004;101:14102-14107). Here,
   this folding energy landscape is used to parameterize a kinetic model in
   which local transition probabilities between partly folded states are
   based on energy values from the landscape. The landscape-based model
   correctly predicts highly diverse experimentally determined folding
   kinetics of the Notch ankyrin domain and sequence variants. These
   predictions include monophasic folding and biphasic unfolding, curvature
   in the unfolding limb of the chevron plot, population of a transient
   unfolding intermediate, relative folding rates of 19 variants spanning
   three orders of magnitude, and a change in the folding pathway that
   results from C-terminal stabilization. These findings indicate that the
   folding pathway(s) of the Notch ankyrin domain are thermodynamically
   selected: the primary determinants of kinetic behavior can be simply
   deduced from the local stability of individual repeats.}},

Title = {{De novo identification of highly diverged protein repeats by

Abstract = {{Motivation: An estimated 25\% of all eukaryotic proteins contain
   repeats, which underlines the importance of duplication for evolving new
   protein functions. Internal repeats often correspond to structural or
   functional units in proteins. Methods capable of identifying diverged
   repeated segments or domains at the sequence level can therefore assist
   in predicting domain structures, inferring hypotheses about function and
   mechanism, and investigating the evolution of proteins from smaller
   fragments.
   Results: We present HHrepID, a method for the de novo identification of
   repeats in protein sequences. It is able to detect the sequence
   signature of structural repeats in many proteins that have not yet been
   known to possess internal sequence symmetry, such as outer membrane
   beta-barrels. HHrepID uses HMMHMM comparison to exploit evolutionary
   information in the form of multiple sequence alignments of homologs. In
   contrast to a previous method, the new method (1) generates a multiple
   alignment of repeats; (2) utilizes the transitive nature of homology
   through a novel merging procedure with fully probabilistic treatment of
   alignments; (3) improves alignment quality through an algorithm that
   maximizes the expected accuracy; (4) is able to identify different kinds
   of repeats within complex architectures by a probabilistic domain
   boundary detection method and (5) improves sensitivity through a new
   approach to assess statistical significance.}},

Abstract = {{The ocelli are three simple photoreceptors on the vertex of the fruit
   fly head. We sought to identify the gene encoded by the classical
   ocellar mutant, reduced ocelli (rdo). Deficiency and inversion
   breakpoint mapping and P-element induced male recombination analyses
   were performed and Pray For Elves (PFE; CG15151; Fbgn0032661) emerged as
   a promising candidate for the rdo phenotype. The PFE locus maps to
   polytene region 36E on chromosome 2L between elfless (Fbgn0032660) and
   Arrestin 1 (Fbgn0000120). FlyBase annotation predicts that PFE encodes a
   serine/threonine kinase, yet protein prediction programs revealed no
   kinase domain. These analyses suggest that PFE simply encodes a leucine
   rich repeat molecule of unknown function, but presumably functions in
   nervous system protein-protein interaction. Two classical spontaneous
   alleles of rdo, rdo(1) and rdo(2), were characterized and the underlying
   mutations result from a small deletion spanning exon 1/intron 1 and a
   B104/roo insertion into the 3'UTR of PFE, respectively.
   Transposase-mediated excisions of several P-elements inserted into the
   PFE locus revert the rdo phenotype and a full-length PFE cDNA is
   sufficient to rescue rdo. A Gal4 enhancer trap reveals a broad adult
   neural expression pattern for PFE. Our identification and initial
   characterization of the rdo locus will contribute to the understanding
   of neurogenesis and neural development in the simple photoreceptors of
   the Drosophila visual system.}},

Abstract = {{In a search of new, small leucine-rich repeat proteoglycan/protein
   (SLRP) family members, a novel gene, nephrocan (NPN), has been
   identified. The gene consists of three exons, and based on the deduced
   amino acid sequence, NPN has 17 leucine-rich repeat motifs and unique
   cysteine-rich clusters both in the N and C termini, indicating that this
   gene belongs to a new class of SLRP family. NPN mRNA was predominantly
   expressed in kidney in adult mice, and during mouse embryogenesis, the
   expression was markedly increased in 11-day-old embryos at a time when
   early kidney development takes place. In the adult mouse kidney, NPN
   protein was located in distal tubules and collecting ducts. When NPN was
   overexpressed in cell culture, the protein was detected in the cultured
   medium, and upon treatment with N-glycosidase F, the molecular mass was
   lowered by similar to 14 kDa, indicating that NPN is a secreted
   N-glycosylated protein. Furthermore, transforming growth
   factor-beta(TGF-beta)-responsive 3TP promoter luciferase activity was
   down-regulated, and TGF-beta-induced Smad3 phosphorylation was also
   inhibited by NPN, suggesting that NPN suppresses TGF-beta/Smad
   signaling. Taken together, NPN is a novel member of the SLRP family that
   may play important roles in kidney development and pathophysiology by
   functioning as an endogenous inhibitor of TGF-beta signaling.}},

Abstract = {{The genome of the diurnal cyanobacterium Cyanothece sp. PCC 51142 has
   recently been sequenced and observed to contain 35 pentapeptide repeat
   proteins (PRPs). These proteins, while present throughout the
   prokaryotic and eukaryotic kingdoms, are most abundant in cyanobacteria.
   The sheer number of PRPs in cyanobacteria coupled with their predicted
   location in every cellular compartment argues for important, yet
   unknown, physiological and biochemical functions. To gain biochemical
   insights, the crystal structure for Rfr32, a 167-residue PRP with an
   N-terminal 29-residue signal peptide, was determined at 2.1 angstrom
   resolution. The structure is dominated by 21 tandem pentapeptide repeats
   that fold into a right-handed quadrilateral beta-helix, or Rfr-fold, as
   observed for the tandem pentapeptide repeats in the only other PRP
   structure, the mycobacterial fluoroquinoline resistance protein MfpA
   from Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Sitting on top of the Rfr-fold are two
   short, antiparallel alpha-helices, bridged with a disulfide bond, that
   perhaps prevent edge-to-edge aggregation at the C terminus. Analysis of
   the main-chain (Phi, Psi) dihedral orientations for the pentapeptide
   repeats in Rfr32 and MfpA makes it possible to recognize the structural
   details for the two distinct types of four-residue turns adopted by the
   pentapeptide repeats in the Rfr-fold. These turns, labeled type II and
   type IV beta-turns, may be universal motifs that shape the Rfr-fold in
   all PRPs.}},

Abstract = {{Genes composed of tandem repetitive sequence motifs are abundant in
   nature and are enriched in eukaryotes. To investigate repeat protein
   gene formation mechanisms, we have conducted a large-scale analysis of
   their introns and exons. We find that a wide variety of repeat motifs
   exhibit a striking conservation of intron position and phase, and are
   composed of exons that encode one or two complete repeats. These results
   suggest a simple model of repeat protein gene formation from local
   duplications. This model is corroborated by amino acid sequence
   similarity patterns among neighboring repeats from various repeat
   protein genes. The distribution of one- and two-repeat exons indicates
   that intron-facilitated repeat motif duplication, in which the start and
   end points of duplication are located in consecutive intronic regions,
   significantly exceeds intron-independent duplication. These results
   suggest that introns have contributed to the greater abundance of repeat
   protein genes in eukaryotic versus prokaryotic organisms, a conclusion
   that is supported by taxonomic analysis. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The protein called `suppressor of the dis2 mutant (sds22(+))' is an
   essential regulator of cell division in fission and budding yeasts,
   where its deletion causes mitotic arrest. Its role in cell cycle control
   appears to be mediated through the activation of protein phosphatase
   type 1 (PP1) in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. We have identified the
   Plasmodium falciparum Sds22 orthologue, which we designated PfLRR1 as it
   belongs to the leucine-rich repeat protein family. We showed by
   glutathione-S-transferase pull-down assay that the PfLRR1 gene product
   interacts with PfPP1, that the PfLRR1-PfPP1 complex is present in
   parasite extracts and that PfLRR1 inhibits PfPP1 activity. Functional
   studies in Xenopus oocytes revealed that PfLRR1 interacted with
   endogenous PP1 and overcame the G2/M cell cycle checkpoint by promoting
   progression to germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD). Confirmatory results
   showing the appearance of GVBD were observed when oocytes were treated
   with anti-PP1 antibodies or okadaic acid. Taken together, these
   observations suggest that PfLRR1 can regulate the cell cycle by binding
   to PP1 and regulating its activity.}},

Abstract = {{We describe here the rapid selection of specific MAP-kinase binders from
   a combinatorial library of designed ankyrin repeat proteins (DARPins). A
   combined in vitro/in vivo selection approach, based on ribosome display
   and the protein fragment complementation assay (PCA), yielded a large
   number of different binders that are fully functional in the cellular
   cytoplasm. Ribosome-display selection pools of four successive selection
   rounds were examined to monitor the enrichment of JNK2-specific DARPins.
   Surprisingly, only one round of ribosome display with subsequent PCA
   selection of this pool was necessary to isolate a first specific binder
   with micromolar affinity. After only two rounds of ribosome-display
   selection followed by PCA, virtually all DARPins showed JNK2-specific
   binding, with affinities in the low nanomolar range. The enrichment
   factor of ribosome display thus approaches 10(5) per round. In a second
   set of experiments, similar results were obtained with the kinases JNK1
   and p38 as targets. Again, almost all investigated DARPins obtained
   after two rounds of ribosome display showed specific binding to the
   targets used, JNK1 or p38. In all three selection experiments the
   identified DARPins possess very high specificity for the target kinase.
   Taken together, the combination of ribosome display and PCA selections
   allowed the identification of large pools of binders at unparalleled
   speed. Furthermore, DARPins are applicable in intracellular selections
   and immunoprecipitations from the extract of eukaryotic cells.}},

Abstract = {{The tails of core histones (H2A, H2B, H3 and H4) are critical for the
   regulation of chromatin dynamics. Each core histone tail is specifically
   recognized by various tail binding proteins. Here we screened for
   budding yeast histone H4-tail binding proteins in a protein differential
   display approach by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DGE). To
   obtain highly enriched chromatin proteins, we used a Mg2+-dependent
   chromatin oligomerization technique. The Mg2+-dependent oligomerized
   chromatin from H4-tail deleted cells was compared with that from
   wild-type cells. We used mass spectrometry to identify 22 candidate
   proteins whose amounts were reduced in the oligomerized chromatin from
   the H4-tail deleted cells. A Saccharomyces Genome Database search
   revealed 10 protein complexes, each of which contained more than two
   candidate proteins. Interestingly, 7 out of the 10 complexes have the
   potential to associate with the H4-tail. We obtained in vivo evidence,
   by a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, that one of the candidate
   proteins, Pwp1p, associates with the 25S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) chromatin
   in an H4-tail-dependent manner. We propose that the complex containing
   Pwp1p regulates the transcription of rDNA. Our results demonstrate that
   the protein differential display approach by 2DGE, using a histone-tail
   mutant, is a powerful method to identify histone-tail binding proteins.}},

Abstract = {{SUMO (small ubiquitin-like modifier) is a member of the ubiquitin family
   of proteins. SUMO targets include proteins involved in numerous roles
   including nuclear transport and transcriptional regulation. The previous
   finding that mutant ataxin-1{[}82Q] disrupted promyelocytic leukemia
   (PML) oncogenic domains prompted us to determine whether ataxin-1
   disrupts another component of PML oncogenic domains, Sp100 (100-kDa
   Speckled protein). Similar to the PML protein, mutant ataxin-1{[} 82Q]
   redistributed Sp100 to mutant ataxin-1{[}82Q] nuclear inclusions. Based
   on the ability of PML and Sp100 to be covalently modified by SUMO, we
   investigated the ability of ataxin-1 to be SUMOylated. SUMO-1 was found
   to covalently modify the polyglutamine repeat protein ataxin-1. There
   was a decrease in ataxin-1 SUMOylation in the presence of the expanded
   polyglutamine tract, ataxin-1{[}82Q]. The phospho-mutant,
   ataxin-1{[}82Q]-S776A, restored SUMO levels to those of wild-type
   ataxin-1{[}30Q]. SUMOylation of ataxin-1 was dependent on a functional
   nuclear localization signal. Ataxin-1 SUMOylation was mapped to at least
   five lysine residues. Lys16, Lys194 preceding the polyglutamine tract,
   Lys(610)/Lys(697) in the C-terminal ataxin high mobility group domain,

Abstract = {{In this paper, we report a novel pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) protein
   gene in rice. PPR, a characteristic repeat motif consisted of tandem 35
   amino acids, has been found in various biological systems including
   plant. Sequence analysis revealed that the gene designated OsPPR1
   consisted of an open reading frame of 2433 nucleotides encoding 8 10
   amino acids that include 11 PPR motifs. Blast search result indicated
   that the gene did not align with any of the characterized PPR genes in
   plant. The OsPPR1 gene was found to contain a putative chloroplast
   transit peptide in the N-terminal region, suggesting that the gene
   product targets to the chloroplast. Southern blot hybridization
   indicated that the OsPPR1 is the member of a gene family within the rice
   genome. Expression analysis and immunoblot analysis suggested that the
   OsPPR1 was accumulated mainly in rice leaf. Antisense transgenic
   strategy was used to suppress the expression of OsPPR1 and the resulted
   transgenic rice showed the typical phenotypes of chlorophyll-deficient
   mutants; albinism and lethality. Cytological observation using
   microscopy revealed that the antisense transgenic plant contained a
   significant defect in the chloroplast development. Taken together, the
   results suggest that the OsPPR1 is a nuclear gene of rice, encoding the
   PPR protein that might play a role in the chloroplast biogenesis. This
   is the first report on the PPR protein required for the chloroplast
   biogenesis in rice.}},

Abstract = {{Ezrin, a linker between plasma membrane and actin cytoskeleton possesses
   morphogenic properties and can promote dissemination of tumor cells.
   Ezrin is phosphorylated on tyrosine, but a detailed picture of the
   signaling pathways involved in this modification is lacking. The
   transforming tyrosine kinase Src has various cytoskeletal substrates and
   is involved in regulation of cellular adhesion. We studied the role of
   Src in tyrosine phosphorylation of ezrin in adherent cells. We show that
   ezrin is phosphorylated in human embryonic kidney 293 cells in a Src
   family-dependent way. In SYF cells lacking Src, Yes, and Fyn, ezrin was
   not tyrosine-phosphorylated but reintroduction of wild-type Src followed
   by Src activation or introduction of active Src restored
   phosphorylation. Mapping of the Src-catalyzed tyrosine in vitro and in
   vivo by site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated Tyr(477) as the primary
   target residue. We generated a pTyr(477)-phosphospecific antibody, which
   confirmed that Tyr(477) becomes phosphorylated in cells in a
   Src-dependent manner. Tyr(477) phosphorylation did not affect ezrin
   head-to-tail association or phosphorylation of ezrin on threonine 566,
   indicating that the function of Tyr(477) phosphorylation is not related
   to the intramolecular regulation of ezrin. A modified yeast two-hybrid
   screen in which ezrin bait was phosphorylated by Src identified a novel
   interaction with a kelch-repeat protein family member, KBTBD2
   (Kelch-repeat and BTB/POZ domain containing 2). The Src dependence of
   the interaction was further verified by affinity precipitation assays.
   Identification of a functional interplay with Src opens novel avenues
   for further characterization of the biological activities of ezrin.}},

Journal = {{NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{18}},
Pages = {{5728-5739}},
Abstract = {{We report the characterization of a novel factor, Rsa4p (Ycr072cp),
   which is essential for the synthesis of 60S ribosomal subunits. Rsa4p is
   a conserved WD-repeat protein that seems to localize in the nucleolus.
   In vivo depletion of Rsa4p results in a deficit of 60S ribosomal
   subunits and the appearance of half-mer polysomes. Northern
   hybridization and primer extension analyses of pre-rRNA and mature rRNAs
   show that depletion of Rsa4p leads to the accumulation of the 27S, 25.5S
   and 7S pre-rRNAs, resulting in a reduction of the mature 25S and 5.8S
   rRNAs. Pulse-chase analyses of pre-rRNA processing reveal that, at
   least, this is due to a strong delay in the maturation of 27S pre-rRNA
   intermediates to mature 25S rRNA. Furthermore, depletion of Rsa4p
   inhibited the release of the pre-60S ribosomal particles from the

   provides a platform of interaction for correct processing of rRNA
   precursors and nucleolar release of 60S ribosomal subunits.}},

Abstract = {{The rice (Oryza sativa) spotted leaf11 (spl11) mutant was identified
   from an ethyl methanesulfonate-mutagenized indica cultivar IR68
   population and was previously shown to display a spontaneous cell death
   phenotype and enhanced resistance to rice fungal and bacterial
   pathogens. Here, we have isolated Spl11 via a map-based cloning
   strategy. The isolation of the Spill gene was facilitated by the
   identification of three additional spill alleles from an IR64 mutant
   collection. The predicted SPL11 protein contains both a U-box domain and
   an armadillo (ARM) repeat domain, which were demonstrated in yeast and
   mammalian systems to be involved in ubiquitination and protein-protein
   interactions, respectively. Amino acid sequence comparison indicated
   that the similarity between SPL11 and other plant U-box-ARM proteins is
   mostly restricted to the U-box and ARM repeat regions. A single base
   substitution was detected in spl11, which results in a premature stop
   codon in the SPL11 protein. Expression analysis indicated that Spl11 is
   induced in both incompatible and compatible riceblast interactions. In
   vitro ubiquitination assay indicated that the SPL11 protein possesses E3
   ubiquitin ligase activity that is dependent on an intact U-box domain,
   suggesting a role of the ubiquitination system in the control of plant
   cell death and defense.}},

Abstract = {{Sphingosine kinase (SPHK) is a key enzyme catalysing the formation of
   sphingosine 1-phosphate (SPP), a lipid messenger that is implicated in
   the regulation of a wide variety of important cellular events acting
   through intracellular, as well as extracellular, mechanisms. However,
   the molecular mechanism of intracellular actions of SPP remains unclear.
   Here, we have identified delta-catenin/NPRAP (neural plakophilin-related
   armadillo repeat protein) as a potential binding partner for SPHK1 by
   yeast two-hybrid screening. From co-immunoprecipitation analyses, the
   C-terminal portion of delta-catenin/NPRAP containing the seventh to
   tenth armadillo repeats was found to be required for interaction with
   SPHK1. Endogenous delta-catenin/NPRAP was co-localized with endogenous
   SPHK1 and transfected delta-catenin/NPRAP was co-localized with
   transfected SPHK1 in dissociated rat hippocampal neurons. MDCK
   (Madin-Darby canine kidney) cells stably expressing delta-catenin/NPRAP
   contained elevated levels of intracellular SPP. In a purified system
   delta-catenin/NPRAP stimulated SPHK1 in a dose-dependent manner.
   Furthermore, delta-catenin/NPRAP-induced increased cell motility in MDCK
   cells was completely inhibited by dimethylsphingosine, a specific
   inhibitor of SPHK1. These results strongly suggest that at least some of
   delta-catenin/NPRAP functions, including increased cell motility, are
   mediated by an SPHK-SPP signalling pathway.}},

Abstract = {{The CALRR1 gene, expressed in pepper leaves following infection by
   Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria, encodes a secreted leucine-rich
   repeat (LRR) with five tandem repeats of a 24-amino-acid LRR motif
   Northern blot analyses revealed that CALRR1 is not constitutively
   expressed in pepper plants, but is strongly induced upon the infection
   by X campestris pv. vesicatoria, Phytophthora capsici, Colletotrichum
   coccodes and Colletotrichum gloeosporioides on leaves. CALRR1 was not
   systemically induced in upper leaves by bacterial infection. The
   inoculation of bacterial live cells, and treatment with dead cells and
   culture filtrates of pathogenic or nonpathogenic bacteria triggered the
   accumulation of CALRR1 transcripts. Treatment with signaling molecules,
   including sallicylic acid (SA), ethylene (ET), methyl jasmonate (MeJA),
   DL-beta-amino-n-butyric acid (BABA) and benzothiadiazole (BTH), did not
   activate the transcription of the CALRR1 gene, indicating that CALRR1
   expression is not regulated by defense signaling pathways activated by
   these molecules. CALRR1 was induced by treatment with high salinity,
   abscisic acid (ABA) and wounding, but not by drought and cold stress. An
   in situ hybridization study showed that CALRR1 mRNA was localized in
   phloem tissues of leaves, stems, and green fruits of pepper plants
   during the pathogen infection and ABA exposure. The location
   characteristics and the spatio-temporal expression pattern of CALRR1
   suggest that it may play a role in protecting phloem cells against
   biotic and abiotic stresses affecting phloem function. (C) 2004 Elsevier

Abstract = {{We have identified and characterized a novel single span transmembrane
   leucine-rich repeat protein, synleurin, that renders cells highly
   sensitive to the activation by cytokines and lipopolysaccharide (LPS).
   The major part of the extracellular domain consists of a leucine-rich
   repeats (LRR) cassette. The LRR central core has 12 analogous LRR
   repeating modules arranged in a seamless tandem array. The LRRs are most
   homologous to that of chondroadherin, insulin-like growth factor binding
   proteins, platelet glycoprotein V, slits, and toll-like receptors.
   Synleurin expression was detected at low levels in many tissues,
   including smooth muscle, brain, uterus. pancreas, cartilage, adipose,
   spleen, and testis. When synleurin is ecotopically expressed in
   transfected cells, the cells exhibit amplified responses to bFGF. EGF,
   PDGF-B, IGF-1, IGF-2, and LPS. Synleurin gene (slrn) maps to human
   chromosome at 5q12. The name synleurin reflects its synergistic effect
   on cytokine stimulation and its prominent leucine-rich repeats. (C) 2003

Abstract = {{Ogura cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) in radish (Raphanus sativus) is
   caused by an aberrant mitochondrial gene, Orf138, that prevents the
   production of functional pollen without affecting female fertility. Rfo,
   a nuclear gene that restores male fertility, alters the expression of
   Orf138 at the post-transcriptional level. The Ogura CMS/Rfo
   two-component system is a useful model for investigating nuclear -
   cytoplasmic interactions, as well as the physiological basis of
   fertility restoration. Using a combination of positional cloning and
   microsynteny analysis of Arabidopsis thaliana and radish, we genetically
   and physically delimited the Rfo locus to a 15-kb DNA segment. Analysis
   of this segment shows that Rfo is a member of the pentatricopeptide
   repeat (PPR) family. In Arabidopsis, this family contains more than 450
   members of unknown function, although most of them are predicted to be
   targeted to mitochondria and chloroplasts and are thought to have roles

Abstract = {{The technique of representational difference analysis of cDNA has been
   applied to screen for differentially expressed genes in a canine model
   of pacing-induced heart failure. We identified the canine homolog of the

   involved in the regulation of the transcription of cardiac genes. To
   confirm the significance for human heart failure, cardiac tissue
   specimens obtained from non-failing donor hearts and from explanted
   hearts from patients with end-stage heart failure were investigated.
   CARP mRNA and protein levels were markedly increased in failing left
   ventricles. Interestingly, alterations in CARP expression were
   restricted to ventricular tissue and were not observed in atria.
   Fractionation experiments revealed that CARP was expressed predominantly
   in the nuclei consistent with the proposed function of CARP as a
   modulator of transcription. Together, these findings raise the
   possibility that augmented ventricular CARP expression may play a role
   in the pathogenesis of human heart failure. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{We have recently described a large (20 S) protein arginine
   methyltransferase complex, termed the methylosome, that contains the
   methyltransferase JBP1 (PRMT5) and the pICln protein. The methylosome
   functions to modify specific arginines to dimethylarginines in the
   arginine- and glycine-rich domains of several spliceosomal Sm proteins,
   and this modification targets these proteins to the survival of motor
   neurons (SMN) complex for assembly into small nuclear ribonucleoprotein
   (snRNP) core particles. Here, we describe a novel component of the
   methylosome, a 50-kilodalton WD repeat protein termed methylosome
   protein 50 (MEP50). We show that MEP50 is important for methylosome
   activity and binds to JBP1 and to a subset of Sm proteins. Because WD
   repeat proteins provide a platform for multiple protein interactions,
   MEP50 may function to mediate the interaction of multiple substrates
   with the methylosome. Interestingly, all of the known components of the
   methylosome bind Sm proteins, suggesting that in addition to producing
   properly methylated substrates for the SMN complex, the methylosome may
   be involved in Sm protein rearrangements or pre-assembly required for
   snRNP biogenesis.}},

Abstract = {{Merozoite surface protein 3 (MSP3), an important vaccine candidate, is a
   soluble polymorphic antigen associated with the surface of Plasmodium
   falciparum merozoites. The MSP3 sequence contains three blocks of heptad
   repeats that are consistent with the formation of an intramolecular
   coiled-coil. MSP3 also contains a glutamic acid-rich region and a
   putative leucine zipper sequence at the C-terminus. We have disrupted
   the msp3 gene by homologous recombination, resulting in the expression
   of a truncated form of MSP3 that lacks the putative leucine zipper
   sequence but retains the glutamic acid-rich region and the heptad
   repeats. Here, we show that truncated MSP3, lacking the putative leucine
   zipper region, does not localize to the parasitophorous vacuole or
   interact with the merozoite surface. Furthermore, the acidic-basic
   repeat antigen (ABRA), which is present on the merozoite surface, also
   was not localized to the merozolte surface in parasites expressing the
   truncated form of MSP3. The P falciparum merozoites lacking MSP3 and
   ABRA on the surface show reduced invasion into erythrocytes. These
   results suggest that MSP3 is not absolutely essential for blood stage
   growth and that the putative leucine zipper region is required for the
   trafficking of both MSP3 and ABRA to the parasitophorous vacuole.}},

Abstract = {{Densin-180, a protein purified from the postsynaptic density fraction of
   the rat forebrain, is the founding member of a newly described family of
   proteins termed the LAP (leucine-rich repeats and PSD-95/Dlg-A/ZO-1
   (PDZ) domains) family that plays essential roles in establishment of
   cell polarity. To identify Densin-180-binding proteins, we screened a
   yeast two-hybrid library using the carboxyl-terminal fragment of
   Densin-180 containing PDZ domain as bait, and we isolated
   delta-catenin/neural plakophilin-related armadillo repeat protein
   (NPRAP) as a Densin-180-interacting protein. delta-catenin/NPRAP, a
   member of the armadillo repeat family, is a nervous system-specific
   adherens junction protein originally discovered as an interactor with
   presenilin-1, a protein involved in Alzheimer's disease. Densin-180 PDZ
   domain binds the COOH terminus of delta-catenin/NPRAP containing the PDZ
   domain-binding sequence. Endogenous Densin-180 was co-immunoprecipitated
   with delta-catenin/NPRAP and N-cadherin. Although Densin-180 was
   reported to be a transmembrane protein, Densin-180 was not accessible to
   surface biotinylation in dissociated hippocampal neurons; hence
   Densin-180 may be a cytosolic protein. Densin-180 colocalized with
   delta-catenin/NPRAP at synapses in dissociated hippocampal neurons. We
   propose that Densin-180 is associated in vivo with delta-catenin/NPRAP
   and may be involved in organization of the synaptic cell-cell junction
   through interaction with the delta-catenin/NPRAP-N-cadherin complex.}},

Abstract = {{The survival of motor neurons (SMN) protein is the product of the
   disease gene of spinal muscular atrophy and is found both in the
   cytoplasm and the nucleus, where it is concentrated in gems. SMN is part
   of a multiprotein complex that includes Gemin2, Gemin3, and Gemin4. The
   SMN complex plays an important role in the cytoplasmic assembly of small
   nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) and likely other RNPs in pre-mRNA
   splicing and in the assembly of transcriptosomes. Here, we report the
   identification of an additional component of the SMN complex, a novel WD
   repeat protein termed Gemin5. Gemin5 binds SMN directly and is a
   component of the SMN complex. Furthermore, Gemin5 interacts with several
   of the snRNP core proteins including SmB, SmD1, SmD2, SmD3, and SmE,
   suggesting that it participates in the activities of the SMN complex in
   snRN-P assembly. Immunolocalization studies demonstrate that Gemin5 is
   found in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus, where it colocalizes with SMN
   in gems. The presence of 13 W-D repeat domains in the amino-terminal
   half of Gemin5 and a coiled-coil motif near its carboxyl terminus
   indicate that it may form a large heteromeric complex and engage in
   multiple interactions.}},

   endonuclein protein expression and localization was cell cycle
   dependent, with increasing levels and nuclear focusing during the
   interphase toward mitosis. Ultrastructural analysis revealed ER and

Abstract = {{The discovery of molecules required for membrane fusion has revealed a
   remarkably conserved mechanism that centers upon the formation of a
   complex of SNARE proteins. However, whether the SNARE proteins or other
   components catalyze the final steps of membrane fusion in vivo remains
   unclear. Understanding this last step depends on the identification of
   molecules that act late in the fusion process. Here we demonstrate that
   in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Vac8p, a myristoylated and palmitoylated
   armadillo repeat protein, is required for homotypic vacuole fusion.
   Vac8p is palmitoylated during the fusion reaction, and the ability of
   Vac8p to be palmitoylated appears to be necessary for its function in
   fusion. Both in vivo and in vitro analyses show that Vac8p functions
   after both Rab-dependent vacuole docking and the formation of
   trans-SNARE pairs. We propose that Vac8p may bind the fusion machinery
   through its armadillo repeats and that palmitoylation brings this
   machinery to a specialized lipid domain that facilitates bilayer mixing.}},

Abstract = {{The heterodimeric. Elongin BC complex has been shown to interact in
   vitro and in mammalian cells with a conserved BC-box motif found in a
   growing number of proteins including RNA polymerase Il elongation factor
   Elongin A, SOCS-box proteins, and the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor
   suppressor protein. Recently, the VHL-EIongin BC complex was found to
   interact with a module composed of Cullin family member Cul2 and RING-H2
   finger protein Rbx1 to reconstitute a novel E3 ubiquitin ligase that
   activates ubiquitylation by the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes Ubc5
   and Cdc34. In the context of: the VEL ubiquitin ligase, Elongin BC
   functions as an adaptor that links the VHL protein to the CuI2/Rbx1
   module, raising the possibility that the Elongin BC complex could
   function as an integral component of a larger family of E3 ubiquitin
   ligases by linking alternative BC-box proteins to Cullin/Rbx1 modules.
   In this report, we describe identification and purification from rat
   liver of a novel leucine-rich repeat-containing BO-box protein, MUF1,
   which we demonstrate is capable of assembling, with a Cullin/Rbx1 module
   containing the Cullin family member Cul5 to reconstitute ubiquitin
   ligase activity. In addition, we show that the additional BC-box,
   proteins Elongin A, SOCS1, and WSB1 are also capable of assembling with
   the Cul5/Rbx1. module to reconstitute potential ubiquitin ligases. Taken
   together, our findings identify MUF1 as a new member of the BO-box
   family of proteins, and they predict the existence of a larger family of
   Elongin BC-based E3 ubiquitin ligases.}},

   TE1, with an antibody directed to a hypothetical protein encoded by
   antisense p53 mRNA. Arpp protein is composed of 333 amino acids and
   contains four ankyrin-like repeat motifs in the middle portion of the
   protein, a PEST-like sequence and a lysine-rich sequence similar to a
   nuclear localization signal in the N-terminal region, and a proline-rich
   region containing consensus phosphorylation sites in the C-terminal
   region. Protein sequence analysis revealed that Arpp is homologous
   (52.7\% identity) to Carp which is shown to be involved in the
   regulation of the transcription of the cardiac ventricular myosin light
   chain 2 gene. Arpp mRNA was found to be expressed in normal skeletal and

   bilateral ventricles, but undetectable in bilateral atria and large

Abstract = {{ARM and HEAT motifs are tandemly repeated sequences of approximately 50
   amino acid residues that occur in a wide variety of eukaryotic proteins.
   An exhaustive search of sequence databases detected new family members
   and revealed that at least 1 in 500 eukaryotic protein sequences contain
   such repeats. It also rendered the similarity between ARM and HEAT
   repeats, believed to be evolutionarily related, readily apparent. All
   the proteins identified in the database searches could be clustered by
   sequence similarity into four groups: canonical ARM-repeat proteins and
   three groups of the more divergent HEAT-repeat proteins. This allowed us
   to build improved sequence profiles for the automatic detection of
   repeat motifs. Inspection of these profiles indicated that the
   individual repeat motifs of all four classes share a common set of seven
   highly conserved hydrophobic residues, which in proteins of known
   three-dimensional structure are buried within or between repeats.
   However, the motifs differ at several specific residue positions,
   suggesting important structural or functional differences among the
   classes. Our results illustrate that ARM and HEAT-repeat proteins, while
   having a common phylogenetic origin, have since diverged significantly.
   We discuss evolutionary scenarios that could account for the great
   diversity of repeats observed. (C) 2001 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{Asporin, a novel member of the leucine-rich repeat family of proteins,
   was partially purified from human articular cartilage and meniscus.
   Cloning of human and mouse asporin cDNAs revealed that the protein is
   closely related to decorin and biglycan. It contains a putative
   propeptide, 4 amino-terminal cysteines, 10 leucine-rich repeats, and 2
   C-terminal cysteines. In contrast to decorin and biglycan, asporin is
   not a proteoglycan. Instead, asporin contains a unique stretch of
   aspartic acid residues in its amino-terminal region. A polymorphism was
   identified in that the number of consecutive aspartate residues varied
   from 11 to 15. The 8 exons of the human asporin gene span 26 kilobases
   on chromosome 9q31.1-32, and the putative promoter region lacks TATA
   consensus sequences. The asporin mRNA is expressed in a variety of human
   tissues with higher levels in osteoarthritic articular cartilage, aorta,
   uterus, heart, and liver. The deduced amino acid sequence of asporin was
   confirmed by mass spectrometry of the isolated protein resulting in 84\%
   sequence coverage. The protein contains an N-glycosylation site at
   Asn(281) with a heterogeneous oligosaccharide structure and a potential
   O-glycosylation site at Ser(54). The name asporin reflects the
   aspartate-rich amino terminus and the overall similarity to decorin.}},

Abstract = {{Synechocystis PCC6803 possesses several open reading frames encoding
   putative WD-repeat proteins. One, the Hat protein, is involved in the
   control of a high-affinity transport system for inorganic carbon that is
   active when the cells are grown under a limiting concentration of this
   carbon substrate. The protein is composed of two major domains separated
   by a hydrophobic linker region of 20 amino acid residues. The N-terminal
   domain of Hat has no homolog in standard databases and does not display
   any particular structural features. Eleven WD repeats have been
   identified in the C-terminal moiety. The region encompassing the four
   terminal WD repeats is essential for growth under a limiting inorganic
   carbon regime. The region encompassing the two most terminal WD repeats
   is required for the activity of the high-affinity transport system.
   However, because the Hat protein is located in the thylakoids, it should
   not be itself an element of the transport system. The structural
   organization of the WD-containing domain of Hat was modeled from the
   crystal structure of the G protein P subunit (with seven WD repeats) and
   of hemopexin (a structural analog with four blades). Functional and
   structural data argue in favor of an organization of the Hat WD moiety
   in two subdomains of seven and four WD repeats. The C-terminal 4-mer
   subdomain might interact with another, yet unknown, protein/peptide.
   This interaction could be essential in modulating the stability of the
   4-mer structure and, thus, the accessibility of this subdomain, or at
   least of the region encompassing the last two WD repeats.}},

Abstract = {{We have cloned a novel cDNA encoding a protein with eight WD repeat
   motifs and a domain similar to collagen. As the predicted size of the
   protein was 146 kDa, the gene was named WDC146. Here, we characterized
   the genomic structure, gene products, and the expression profiles. The
   human WDC146 gene had 22 exons spanning over 105 kb, and these exons
   were distributed in three islands intervened by two long introns of
   around 40 kb. A minimum promoter region was identified within a 0.5 kb
   5'-upstream region of exon 1. WDC146 mRNA was most highly expressed in
   human testis on Northern blot analysis. In mouse tissues, the highest
   expression was also observed in testis. By in situ hybridization on rat
   tissues, WDC146 mRNA was detected preferentially in the pachytene stage
   of spermatocytes in testis, and weakly in white pulp/marginal band of
   spleen and in cortex of thymus. WDC146 protein was found to be localized
   in nucleus. These data implied that WDC146 protein may play important
   roles in the mechanisms of cytodifferentiation and/or DNA recombination.

   endoproteinase-degraded PGIP were analyzed by mass spectrometry, and
   four disulfide bonds were identified. Mass spectrometric analysis in
   combination with glycosidase treatments revealed two N-linked
   oligosaccharides located on Asn 64 and Asn 141. The main structure
   resembled the typical complex plant N-glycan consisting of a core
   pentasaccharide beta1,2-xylosylated, carrying an alpha1,3-fucose linked

Abstract = {{Nucleotide excision repair is a highly versatile DNA repair system
   responsible for elimination of a wide variety of lesions from the
   genome. It is comprised of two subpathways: transcription-coupled repair
   that accomplishes efficient removal of damage blocking transcription and
   global genome repair, Recently, the basic mechanism of global genome
   repair has emerged from biochemical studies. However, little is known
   about transcription-coupled repair in eukaryotes, Here we report the
   identification of a novel protein designated XAB2 (XPA-binding protein
   2) that was identified by virtue of its ability to interact with XPA, a
   factor central to both nucleotide excision repair subpathways, The XAB2
   protein of 855 amino acids consists mainly of 15 tetratricopeptide
   repeats. In addition to interacting with XPA, immunoprecipitation
   experiments demonstrated that a fraction of XAB2 is able to interact
   with the transcription-coupled repair-specific proteins CSA and CSB as
   well as RNA polymerase II. Furthermore, antibodies against XAB2
   inhibited both transcription-coupled repair and transcription in vivo
   but not global genome repair when microinjected into living fibroblasts.
   These results indicate that XAB2 is a novel component involved in
   transcription-coupled repair and transcription.}},

Abstract = {{The ankyrin repeat is an abundant, 33 residue sequence motif that forms
   a consecutive beta-hairpin-helix-loop-helix (beta(2)alpha(2)) fold. Most
   ankyrin repeat proteins consist of four or more complete repeats, which
   provide stabilizing interactions between adjacent modules. The
   cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor and tumor suppressor p16(INK4) (p16)
   is one of the smallest ankyrin repeat proteins with a known structure.
   It consists of four complete repeats plus short N and C-terminal
   flanking regions that are unstructured in solution. On the basis of
   preliminary proteolysis studies and predictions using a computer
   algorithm for identifying autonomous folding units, we have identified a
   fragment consisting of the third and fourth ankyrin repeats of p16,
   called p16C, that can fold independently, without the rest of the
   protein. Far-UV circular dichroism studies showed that p16C has a
   significant level of alpha-helical secondary structure, and two proline
   substitutions that disrupt the alpha-helical secondary structure in
   wild-type p16 disrupt the secondary structure in p16C. The thermal
   denaturation of p16C is cooperative and reversible, with a midpoint of
   transition at 30.5(+/-)degrees C. From urea-induced denaturation
   studies, the free energy of unfolding for p16C was estimated to be
   1.7(+/-0.3)kcal/mol at 20 degrees C. H-1-N-15 2D NMR studies suggest
   that the ankyrin repeats in p16C are likely to fold into a structure
   similar to that of full-length p16. In order to define the minimum
   autonomous folding unit in p16, we have further dissected p16C into two
   complementary peptides, each containing a single ankyrin repeat. These
   peptides are unstructured in solution. Thus, p16C is the smallest
   ankyrin repeat module that is known to fold independently and, in
   general, we believe that the two-ankyrin repeat fold could be the
   minimum structural unit for all ankyrin repeat proteins. We further
   discuss the significance of p16C in protein folding and engineering. (C)

Abstract = {{The sequential binding of different tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR)
   proteins to heat shock protein 90 (hsp90) is essential to its chaperone
   function in vivo. We have previously shown that three basic residues in
   the TPR domain of PP5 are required for binding to the acidic C-terminal
   domain of hsp90. We have now tested which acidic residues in this
   C-terminal domain are required for binding to three different TPR
   proteins as follows: PP5, FKBP52, and Hop. Mutation of Glu-729, Glu-730,
   and Asp-732 at the C terminus of hsp90 interfered with binding of all
   three TPR proteins. Mutation of Glu-720, Asp-722, Asp-723, and Asp-724
   inhibited binding of FKBP52 and PP5 but not of Hop. Mutation of Glu-651
   and Asp-653 did not affect binding of FKBP52 or PP5 but inhibited both
   Hop binding and hsp90 chaperone activity. We also found that a conserved
   Lys residue required for PP5 binding to hsp90 was critical for the
   binding of FKBP52 but not for the binding of Hop to hsp90. These results
   suggest distinct but overlapping binding sites on hsp90 for different
   TPR proteins and indicate that the binding site for Hop, which is
   associated with hsp90 in intermediate stages of protein folding,
   overlaps with a site of chaperone activity.}},

Abstract = {{Short protein repeats, frequently with a length between 20 and 40
   residues, represent a significant fraction of known proteins. Many
   repeats appear to possess high amino acid substitution rates and thus
   recognition of repeat homologues is highly problematic. Even if the
   presence of a certain repeat family is known, the exact locations and
   the number of repetitive units often cannot be determined using current
   methods. We have devised an iterative algorithm based on optimal and
   sub-optimal score distributions from profile analysis that estimates the
   significance of all repeats that are detected in a single sequence. This
   procedure allows the identification of homologues at alignment scores
   lower than the highest optimal alignment score for non-homologous
   sequences. The method has been used to investigate the occurrence of
   eleven families of repeats in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Caenorhabditis
   elegans and Homo sapiens accounting for 1055, 2205 and 2320 repeats,
   respectively. For these examples, the method is both more sensitive and
   more selective than conventional homology search procedures. The method
   allowed the detection in the SwissProt database of more than 2000
   previously unrecognised repeats belonging to the 11 families. In
   addition, the method was used to merge several repeat families that
   previously were supposed to be distinct, indicating common phylogenetic
   origins for these families. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{The zebrafish, Danio rerio, has three types of pigment cells
   (melanophores, xanthophores and iridophores) and, in adult fish, these
   cells are organized into a stripe pattern. The mechanisms underlying
   formation of the stripe pattern are largely unknown. We report here the
   identification and characterization of a novel dominant zebrafish
   mutation, hagoromo (hag), which was generated by insertional mutagenesis
   using a pseudotyped tetrovirus. The hag mutation caused disorganized
   stripe patterns. Two hag mutant alleles were isolated independently and
   proviruses were located within the fifth intron of a novel gene, which
   we named hag, encoding an F-box/WD40-repeat protein. The hag gene was
   mapped to linkage group (LG)13, close to fgf8 and pax2.1. Amino acid
   sequence similarity, conserved exon-intron boundaries and conserved
   synteny indicated that zebrafish hag is an ortholog of mouse Dactylin,
   the gene mutated in the Dactylaplasia (Dac) mouse {[}1]. The Dac
   mutation is dominant and causes defects in digit formation in fore- and
   hindlimbs. This study revealed that the hag locus is important for
   pattern formation in fish but is involved in distinct morphogenetic

Abstract = {{In fission yeast, the onset of meiosis is triggered by activation of the
   RNA-binding protein Mei2p. We screened for a high-copy-number suppressor
   of the ectopic meiosis induced by expression of an active form of Mei2p.
   Consequently we isolated a truncated form of a novel gene, named mip1,
   from a fission yeast genomic library. The mip1 gene encoded a protein of
   1,313 amino acids which carried a WD-repeat motif in the C-terminal
   region and was apparently conserved among eukaryotes. Mip1p was
   cytoplasmic, and two-hybrid and immunoprecipitation analyses
   demonstrated that Mip1p aas bound to Mei2p in vivo. Genetic evidence
   indicated that wild-type Mip1p was required for the function of Mei2p to
   induce meiosis and that the truncated form of it (Mip1-15p) dominantly
   interfered with Mei2p. Mip1p appeared to be involved also in
   conjugation, associating with Ste11p, which is a key transcription
   factor for sexual development, Furthermore, Mip1p was essential for cell
   growth, to which neither Mei2p nor Ste11p is relevant. These results
   suggest that Mip1p assists functional expression of a number of proteins
   required for proliferation and sexual development in fission yeast.}},

Abstract = {{The LC1 light chain from Chlamydomonas outer arm dynein is tightly bound

   member of the SDS22+ subclass of the leucine-rich repeat protein family

   and the components of a signal transduction pathway. Through the
   combination of covalent cross-linking and vanadate-mediated photolysis,
   LC1 was found to associate with that portion of the gamma HC that is
   C-terminal to the P1 loop. This region comprises most of the globular
   head domain of the heavy chain and includes the stalk-like structure
   that is involved in microtubule binding. Attachment of LC1 to this
   region represents the only known example of an accessory polypeptide
   directly associated with a dynein motor domain. Additional cross-linking
   experiments revealed that LC1 also interacts directly in situ with an
   similar to 45 kDa axonemal component; this interaction is disrupted by
   the standard high salt treatment used to remove the outer arm from the

Abstract = {{Rat striatin, a quantitatively minor protein belonging to the WD-repeat
   family of proteins, is a Ca2+/calmodulin-binding protein mostly
   expressed in the striatum and in the motor and olfactory systems
   (Castets, F., Bartoli, M., Barnier, J. V., Baillat, G., Salin, P.,
   Moqrich, A., Bourgeois, J. P., Denizot, F., Rougon, G., Calothy, G., and
   Monneron, A. (1996) J. Cell Biol. 134, 1051-1062). Generally associated
   with membranes, striatin is mostly found in dendritic spines where it is
   likely to play a role in Ca2+-signaling events. In this paper, we
   characterize its calmodulin-binding properties. By using deletion
   mapping and site-directed mutagenesis, we identified the sequence
   located between amino acids 149 and 166 as the main calmodulin-binding
   site. The predicted corresponding peptide is potentially able to form a
   basic amphiphilic helix, as is often the case for many known
   calmodulin-binding sites. Calmodulin binding to striatin is
   Ca2+-dependent, with half-maximal binding occurring around 0.5 mu M free
   Ca2+. In the presence of Ca2+, the equilibrium dissociation constant of
   calmodulin/striatin fusion protein complex is 40 +/- 5 nM. me also show
   that brain striatin subcellular localization, as studied by tissue

Abstract = {{The detection and alignment of locally conserved regions (motifs) in
   multiple sequences can provide insight into protein structure, function,
   and evolution. A new Gibbs sampling algorithm is described that detects
   motif-encoding regions in sequences and optimally partitions them into
   distinct motif models; this is illustrated using a set of immunoglobulin
   fold proteins. When applied to sequences sharing a single motif, the
   sampler can be used to classify motif regions into related submodels, as
   is illustrated using helix-turn-helix DNA-binding proteins. Other
   statistically based procedures are described for searching a database
   for sequences matching motifs found by the sampler. When applied to a
   set of 32 very distantly related bacterial integral outer membrane
   proteins, the sampler revealed that they share a subtle, repetitive
   motif. Although BLAST (Altschul SF et al., 1990, J Mol Biol 215:403-410)
   fails to detect significant pairwise similarity between any of the
   sequences, the repeats present in these outer membrane proteins, taken
   as a whole, are highly significant (based on a generally applicable
   statistical test for motifs described here). Analysis of bacterial
   porins with known trimeric beta-barrel structure and related proteins
   reveals a similar repetitive motif corresponding to alternating
   membrane-spanning beta-strands. These beta-strands occur on the membrane
   interface (as opposed to the trimeric interface) of the beta-barrel. The
   broad conservation and structural location of these repeats suggests
   that they play important functional roles.}},

Abstract = {{A pMAL(c)-based plasmid clone with a synthetic tac promoter was
   constructed to efficiently express the full-length terminal repeat
   protein 1 (TP1) of Epstein-Barr virus in Escherichia coli. The
   N-terminal part of the recombinant protein is represented by a
   maltose-binding protein, permitting thereby its isolation from bacterial
   lysates by affinity chromatography. Subsequent treatment with
   proteolytic factor Xa yields the target protein in discrete form. A
   tryptophan-regulated vector pATH-11 was used to construct several
   plasmid clones capable of expressing various N- and C-proximal fragments
   of TP1. This collection can be used to obtain corresponding antisera and
   for preliminary immunological mapping of the TP1 molecule.}},

Abstract = {{The cactus protein is the Drosophila homologue of the mammalian I kappa
   B family of cytoplasmic anchor proteins. We have expressed in E. coli
   and purified a cactus fusion protein, CACT-Bgl. CACT-Bgl protein
   contains the six ankyrin repeat sequences which are necessary for
   specific binding to the Drosophila rel family transcription factor
   dorsal. We show that the purified CACT-Bgl protein can bind specifically
   to dorsal and, using circular dichroism spectroscopy, that the protein
   adopts a largely alpha-helical secondary structure. A further analysis
   of the ankyrin repeat domains of cactus, using an improved secondary
   structure prediction program indicates that the N-terminal of the repeat
   will form into a loop structure and the C-terminal section into an
   interrupted, amphipathic a-helix. On the basis of these findings we
   propose that the ankyrin repeats of cactus fold together into helical
   bundles interconnected by diverged loops.}},

Abstract = {{We report the identification of a previously unknown gene, inlA, which
   is necessary for the gram-positive intracellular pathogen Listeria
   monocytogenes to invade cultured epithelial cells. The inlA region was
   localized by transposon mutagenesis, cloned, and sequenced. inlA was
   introduced into Listeria innocua and shown to confer on this normally
   noninvasive species the ability to enter cells. Sequencing of inlA
   predicts an 80 kd protein, internalin. Two-thirds of internalin is made
   up of two regions of repeats, region A and region B, and the C-terminus
   of the molecule is similar to that of surface proteins from
   gram-positive cocci. Internalin has a high content of threonine and
   serine residues, and the repeat motif of region A has regularly spaced
   leucine residues. As evidenced by Southern blot analysis, inlA is part
   of a gene family. One of them is the gene situated directly downstream
   of inlA, called inlB, which also encodes a leucine-rich repeat protein.}},
